If an extreme one-sided way exists in consciousness,\npsychic energy has to balance this one-sided position.

It has only one meaning - that of bring your vehicle to a complete\nhalt just before this red sign. It doesn\u2019t mean drive through, yield or\nbuy a hamburger or fries.

In classical Freudian psychoanalysis will know that\nmany of the objects that Freud interpreted in dreams say hills or tunnels\nor apples of bananas were referred to in a way that made them signs.  The\napple equals the female breast in Freudian dream interpretation or the\nbanana means the male penis. One sign has one meaning. So it is quite\nincorrect from a Jungian perspective to interpret dream imagery in fixed\nways. From this perspective, stay away from those dreadful dream\ndictionaries you find at bookstores that tell you if you dreamt of an\napple it means a breast or any other such fixed meaning.

What if I get it wrong and say it means something completely\ndifferent from someone else? In this situation you are quite safe because\nyou know what a symbol means to you better than anyone else. Because you\nget a meaning about a symbol from your own unconscious; your own\nfeelings, and your own experiences.  Example:  say you dreamt of a horse.\nYou told your dream to a friend and began to explain the meaning of\na horse. In other words you begin to enlarge on the meaning of the\nsymbol. As a child you may have been thrown from a horse and broken your\narm, and never ridden one since.

Your friend on the other hand, may have been raised on a cattle\nranch and spent many hours of his childhood on the back of a horse\nrounding up cattle. He may have had a favorite horse that he trained and\nrode for the years that he spent at home on the ranch. To him, the horse\nis a solid, powerful, dependable creature that help do his ranch chores,\nwas his good friend and helped him get through some difficult terrain or\ntimes.

As images are such\npowerful images and exist in the collective unconscious, we need to see\nhow different cultures attribute meaning to a different symbol.

There\nis something greater to the symbol of the horse than simply saying it is\nthe thing that threw me and caused me to break my arm.  The first part of\nour work in interpreting a symbol was to develop personal associations to\nthat symbol. The next phase is to develop universal meaning of the\nsymbol, but there is a serious danger in symbol amplification of becoming\noverly intellectual. The key here is to do the research required for the\namplification but to stay with the material that grips your attention. As\nsoon as you find yourself reading about some arcane symbol meaning, in\nsome specific culture you don\u2019t feel anything anymore for the symbol, you\nknow you\u2019ve gone too far. This is especially so in amplifying your dream\nsymbols.  The symbols that you have in your dream are yours and are their\nfor a very specific reason. So amplify only until you feel the symbol\nbegins to lose its value or energy.  Don\u2019t thrash a symbol to death in\namplifying it,  just add something that really peaks your interest or has\nspecific relevance to your dream or to your life. This is a very\ndifficult thing to do as we are all used to overworking the meaning of\nsymbols when we begin this process.
