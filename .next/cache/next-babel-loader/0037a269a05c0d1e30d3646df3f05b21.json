I can't recommend it enough. `}</p>\n    <p>{`Psyche is the totality of all psychic processes conscious and\nunconscious. Conscious plus unconscious plus body equals psyche.  Jung\ndoes not divide the mind and body. We may experience the psyche\nconsciously (like an idea), unconsciously (like a dream) or somatically\n(in the body like anxiety over an upcoming exam). `}</p>\n    <p>{`The unconscious is made of all of our memories whether we can recall them or\nnot, all material not available to the conscious, and all repressed material. `}</p>\n    <p>{`Jung expressed the unconscious negatively in that the unconscious is all that\nis not in conscious.   `}</p>\n    <p>{`In an opographical diagram, Jung’s model contains the conscious, the\npersonal unconscious, the collective unconscious and the body.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`Part I The first layer is the conscious`}</h2>\n    <h3>{`The structure of the conscious is the ego  which has five functions.`}</h3>\n    <ol>\n      <li parentName=\"ol\">{`Stability of personality: My personality remains reasonably stable over\ntime. It would be difficult to relate to others if our personality changes\nfrequently.  Likewise it would be very difficult if our friends and family’s\npersonality changed frequently.  It would be very difficult to relate to\nthem. `}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ol\">{`Stability  of identity over time: Self awareness and self identity is\nstable over time. We know who we are, what we like and dislike, and\nwhat we stand for. When you look in the mirror at night you know you\nwill still be yourself in the morning. Your identity did not change\nwhile you were asleep. Movies show us that a lack of stability of\nidentity is deeply troubling.

He\nspends the rest of the movie working this out.\n`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ol\">{`Cognition: The ability to process information, problem solve and store\nmemory. If you see a friend, you remember who they are, what they like and\ndislike and what bothers them. You remember their shared experiences. Severe\ndepression is a disorder that limits our ability to think through issues, to\nconcentrate, and remember is impacted so we feel isolated.`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ol\">{`Executive function: The ability to deal with everyday life and the\ndemands of the world. For example, we know that we should put\ntoothpaste on the toothbrush before we brush our teeth not after. We do\nthousands of these tasks daily. Aging friends or family who sink into\ndimensia show how important this function this is. They get lost in\ntheir own house and have trouble getting dressed. `}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ol\">{`Reality Testing: The line between conscious and unconscious is more\nblurry than we would believe. Ego performs reality testing to help us\nwith. It is the ability to expect and obey the laws of physics. For\nexample we know to open the car door before we get out of the car. We\ntake the elevator to the ground floor of a building not just fly or\njump. We need this function to get through the day. People who suffer\nfrom psychotic disorder lose this ability. They think they can fly from\nthe fifteenth floor.  `}</li>\n    </ol>\n    <h3>{`The second layer of Jung’s model of is the personal unconscious.`}</h3>\n    <p>{`The part of the unconscious we can mostly access. It is unique to the\nindividual. It structure is made of  complexes. A complex is clusters of\nfeeling turned associations around a common theme. `}</p>\n    <h4>{`The Money Complex Example`}</h4>\n    <p>{`We all have experiences of money. Starting from an early age when we are\ngiven some coins as a gift. We don’t understand  what these coins are, but\nwe know they are important from the way adults talk about money. We hear\nphrases like “Don’t spend it all in one place”, and “Money doesn’t grow on\ntrees”. As we get older we realize we can purchase things with money. We\ngo to the store and buy candy and begin to understand money has powerful\nsignificance. We may hear parents argue about money. We want something\nonly to be told it’s too expensive.  Later we start to earn money and\nrealize a small sum of money requires a lot of hard work.  We hear about\nbanks, interest, and taxes and start to understand money is central to\nthis world. As we start to work and pay bills perhaps we run out of money.  `}</p>\n    <p>{`Each of these experiences has a strong feeling attached. These feelings\nturned association cluster together to create a complex.  The same thing\ncan happen with the father complex, mother complex, competence and many\nothers.  We all have many complexes. `}</p>\n    <p>{`So what? Well when we are triggered by a specific complex that lives in\nour personal unconscious can come up into consciousness and make us behave\ncontrary to our everyday personality. One of the functions of ego is\nstability of personality over time. When we complex out, the ego takes\na beating from the complex and suffers reduced ability to operate\nappropriately. The complex takes over for a short time. When this happens,\nothers may say we behaved in a strange way. What they are saying is our\nnormal personality behavior dropped off the radar for a time.  Another\npersonality popped up in its place. Nobody really likes that new person.`}</p>\n    <p>{`A complex when triggered impacts the ego’s functioning. Jung - “Everyone\nknows people have complexes. What is more important is complexes have\npeople.” Here he is talking about archetypes.`}</p>\n    <h3>{`The Third Layer is the Collective Unconscious`}</h3>\n    <p>{`We cannot experience the collective unconscious directly like we\nexperience complexes as it is deeply unconscious.`}</p>\n    <p>{`This layer is common to all of humanity. Some may doubt this due to lack\nof evidence. Jung provided evidence. Since his time there is little doubt\nthe psyche has symbol producing capacity. For example, almost all humans\nare born with five fingers. Some may not due to genetic defect or\nproblematic pregnancy,  generally all do have five fingers. We don’t ever\nquestion this part of being human as it is self evident. The collective\nconscious is also self-evident. `}</p>\n    <p>{`Humans apart from being tool users, are also symbol makers and\nstory-tellers. We create symbols daily and are surrounded by a symbol\nladen world. Advertising symbols, objects in our world are symbols.\nSpecifically, they are symbolic images or archetypal images. Structures in\nthe collective unconscious are archetypes. “Archetypes are the inherited\npart of the psyche. Structuring patterns of psychological performance\nlinked to instinct. A hypothetical entity irrepresentable in itself and\nevident only through its manifestations.  `}</p>\n    <p>{`An archetype is a symbol producing structure. `}</p>\n    <p>{`“Inherited part of the psyche”\nIt is common to all humans. It is inherited like having five fingers on your left hand. `}</p>\n    <p>{`“Structuring patterns of psychological performance linked to instinct”\nArchetype creates or structures patterns or symbols ways of seeing or\nexperiencing this is linked to instinct. `}</p>\n    <p>{`“Hypothetical Entity”\nA theoretical structure it does not exist at an anatomical level in the\npsyche.  Example of an x-ray.  We go to the x-ray room, put on a gown and\nthe protective equipment and sit in a chair. Then we hear a click. We\ndon’t see anything or perceive anything except a click.  Later we see\na dark film with a ghostly outline of our body. Something did happen but\nwe experience it as the dark x-ray file. `}</p>\n    <p>{`Another example: a recipe.`}</p>\n    <p>{`You don’t eat a recipe but an instance of the recipe that has been\ncreated.  This is much like the relationship between the archetype and the\narchetypal image.`}</p>\n    <p>{`There are many archetypes in the collective unconscious.  We experience\nthem as symbols of our world. We we dream, we recall these archetypal\nimages or symbols. `}</p>\n    <h3>{`Final Layer: The Body`}</h3>\n    <p>{`There is no distinction between the mind and body in analytical\npsychology.  The body expresses the workings of the psyche through\na process called somatization. To make physical that which is\npsychological.  We all experience this when we are in distress or waking\nfrom a nightmare. `}</p>\n    <p>{`The process can also work in reverse. Something may happen to the body\nthat results in the psyche having to deal with it such as slipping and\nfalling or a car accident. `}</p>\n    <p>{`Some patients report the pain of physical trauma is re-experienced when\nrecalling the trauma in an analytical session. `}</p>\n    <hr></hr>\n    <h2>{`Part II Jung’s Model of the Psyche`}</h2>\n    <h3>{`Key Topics`}</h3>\n    <ul>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`Compensation is a critical aspect of the working of the psyche\n(psychodynamics).`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`The psychodynamic result of a one-sided ego stance.`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`The psyche is a self regulating system.

This corresponds to the\nself-regulatory functions of the organism observable in the physiological\nsphere. Compensation means balancing, adjusting, supplementing. He\nregarded the compensatory activity of the unconscious as balancing any\ntendency toward one-sidedness on the part of consciousness.” `}</p>\n    <p>{`Compensation also ties into the one-sidedness of consciousness.  The\npsyche is in a constant dynamic state, but a state where we go far beyond\nsimple homeostasis.  All aspects of the psyche are in a dynamic\nrelationship with each other. It is like the traffic pattern in a city.\nWe know that if something happens far down a busy highway,  close to our\ndestination, that it impacts our commute long before we get to that\nevent.  If a truck stalls on the highway, close to a major onramp, we\nnotice traffic jams occur when we leave each day for our commute. The\npsyche as a system is constantly balancing itself adjusting to the\ndemands of the inner and outer worlds.  The ego tends to get one-sided\nand is compensated for by the unconscious. Or, the unconscious state is\ncompensated for by the body.`}</p>\n    <p>{`This means the system of the psyche has a series of fundamental\ncompensatory mechanisms.  The first is between the ego and the\nunconscious. The one-sided stance the ego takes results in a compensatory\nresponse from the unconscious (often in dreams). We can see the results\nin dreams and the somatic response of the body to psychological issues.\nThe beliefs and attitudes we hold in the conscious results in the body\ntrying to balance this out using compensation. `}</p>\n    <p>{`Another mechanism is between the body and the unconscious. When I feel\nanxious and this stirs up unconscious content, the body expresses this\ndistress through somatic responses. They body expresses the unconscious\nissues in a compensatory fashion.  `}</p>\n    <p>{`Another compensatory mechanism is between the whole psyche and the\nenvironment. If the environment is threatening,  In a threatening\nsituation, say a car accident, the whole psyche responds with anxiety in\nthe ego (I am aware I am anxious). This triggers material in the\nunconscious which reminds me of previous scary incidents I’ve been\nthrough and results in somatic reactions.  `}</p>\n    <p>{`This process of compensation continues unabated throughout our day and\nnight.  `}</p>\n    <p>{`The one-sidedness tendency of consciousness results in the unconscious\ncompensating for this one-sidedness.  `}</p>\n    <p>{`Example: analysts often meet patients who have been successful in their\ncareers and have made a good deal of money, but in analysis they are\ndepressed, find their work meaningless, see no joy in their\nrelationships, and don’t see a way out of the situation. They are\ndescribed as having a mid-life crisis. These experiences often occur in\nmid-life (40s and 50s). They have become too one-sided in their work,\nfamily and lives. They have become a successful money-generating doctor,\nlawyer or businessperson.  In the outside world of status and power they\nappear to have it all. Yet, their inner world they find themselves in\npoverty.  They experience severe depression, somatic complaints, loss of\nhope, lower productivity and relationship problems - all the classic\nsymptoms of depression.  Why would someone so successful be struck with\nsuch suffering? The answer lies in the one-sided position of the\nconscious and the compensatory nature of the psyche. In pursuing career\nsuccess and wealth, they have ignored the inner world of the psyche.\nThese patients don’t recall their dreams, they seldom relax. They don’t\nplay. They spend no time in the symbolic worlds of art and literature and\nhave a dismal time with their family. They have become too one-sided.\nTheir ego stance is that of success at all costs. The compensatory\nprocess is trying to use depression as a mechanism to alert the ego of\nthe need for change. `}</p>\n    <p>{`This can be stated as:  the psyche in its wisdom, knows that the\none-sided way of living cannot continue as a person is living a very\nrestricted life.  `}</p>\n    <p>{`What does it mean that the psyche is trying to adjust the ego stance? The\nclassic mid-life crisis person suffering depression that all layers of\nthe psyche are impacted. The ego’s function is impacted in that the\nperson has a harder time concentrating, is forgetful, is less productive\nand is making mistakes.   The personal unconscious is impacted  in that\na series of complexes are constellated  that drive the person to more\nwork, longer hours and less time to themselves and this or her family.\nComplexes such as achievement or the negative father come to bear and\nmake the person feel outside of his usual self. `}</p>\n    <p>{`Finally, the collective unconscious is involved by bringing powerful\nsymbols to consciousness that often scare the living hell out of the\nperson.  The body also expresses the distress in ways we cannot ignore.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The one-sided stance of the ego  thus produces a necessary but painful\nresponse from the unconscious that seeps through to all layers of the\npsyche.  This is an example of the process of compensation. `}</p>\n    <p>{`The psyche creates the depression to force an adjustment.  Compensation\ngoes far beyond the simple process of homeostasis.  Jung dealt with these\nideas through the process called teleology.  `}</p>\n    <h4>{`Teleology`}</h4>\n    <p>{`Teleology: a process that is directed towards ends rather than causes.\nJung diverges from the psychoanalytic tradition here. In classical\npsychoanalysis experiences are reduced to earlier events. The reductive\napproach of Freud points to earlier childhood issues in order to explain\npresent day suffering is an example of a reductive or causative\nperspective.  Jung’s teleological perspective looks at the current\nsituation in terms of the following idea: `}</p>\n    <p>{`What is this current process trying to lead you towards?  If someone is\nsuffering from anxiety or depression Jung’s questions would be not only\n“How did you come to be at this point in your life”? (reductive) , but\nalso “What is this place your in right now leading you towards?” Jung\ndidn’t reject the reductive approach in fact insisted it needed to be\naddressed first, but then go a step further - what is the teleological\npurpose of the current situation?  What are you being led towards? Where\nwill you end up if you work this piece out?  We can understand there is\nsome system within the psyche that directs what happens and in certain\nsituations creates psychological suffering in order to ameliorate deeper\npsychic suffering. This whole process is directed toward an end position.\nThis is related to the central organizing archetype called the Self. `}</p>\n    <h4>{`The Self`}</h4>\n    <p>{`Archetypes are symbol producing aspects of the collective unconscious.  We\ncannot see an archetype only the image it produces (an instance).  The\ncentral archetype is the Self.  It is the organizing archetype that\nregulates all the other archetypes and the rest of the psyche. The goal of\nthis regulatory process is for the individual to confront the content of\nthe unconscious and engage in the process of individuation.  All that we\nare doing is regulated by the self. The aim of life or the teleological\ngoal of life is union with the Self.   `}</p>\n    <p><em parentName=\"p\">{`Samuels definition of the Self`}</em></p>\n    <p>{`“An archetypal image of man’s fullest potential and the unity of the\npersonality as a whole. The Self as a unifying principle within the human\npsyche occupies the central position of authority in relation to\npsychological life and therefore the destiny of the individual. At times\nJung speaks of the Self as initiatory of psychic life. At other times he\nrefers to its realization as the goal.” `}</p>\n    <p>{`The wisdom of the self: the Self is continually altering the\npsychodynamics of the psyche to help toward the goal of realization of\nthe Self.  This is the inner wisdom of the psyche. `}</p>\n    <p>{`This process makes better sense when we consider  it psychodynamically.  `}</p>\n    <h4>{`The Ego/Self Axis`}</h4>\n    <p>{`1972 Book by Edinger “Ego and Archetype” deals with this topic.  We begin\nlife with a body and the Self. This is all we have until the ego is\ndeveloped. A small ego emerges from the Self and becomes an entity in the\npsyche. During the first half of life the ego receives a lot of attention\nmaking it very powerful.   `}</p>\n    <p>{`All parts of the psyche are in dynamic relation to each other.  The ego\nin the first half of life becomes dominant and rules over all.  At\nmidlife the situation has gone too far and the ego becomes one-sided so\nsomething has to give.  `}</p>\n    <p>{`The example of the successful professional who is struck by depression at\nmidlife is a classic example of ego-Self separation.  The ego is not\ndealing with the content of the unconscious and a poverty now exists. The\npoverty is a lack of connection with the inner symbolic riches of the\nunconscious.  `}</p>\n    <p>{`The second half of life deals with making this reunification possible.\nThe ego has to become more related to the Self and the rest of the psyche\nso if all goes well, the line between the ego and the Self shortens. The\nego accepts the need to relate to the rest of the psyche that it had\ndenied for most of the first half of life.  `}</p>\n    <p>{`The first half of life involves ego-Self separation while the second half\ninvolves ego-Self re-unification.  The ego and the Self need each other\nas they are in relationship. In some cases they become strained in their\nrelationship but overall due to the efforts of the Self result in\na healthier personality. Jung puts it this way: “The ego stands to the\nself as to the moved to the mover.”  `}</p>\n    <p>{`Putting these ideas together compensation:  the one-sidedness of the ego,\nthe Self, teleology and the ego-Self axis. `}</p>\n    <p>{`As we develop our ego gains ascendency in the psyche. Consciousness\nbecome the be all and end all in our opinion. This is the result of us\npushing ourselves harder and harder in the outside or ego based world to\nachieve and accumulate more and become more powerful. All the while the\nSelf is trying to organize the rest of the psyche to deal with this\nsituation through compensation. The more we strive, the more our world is\nbased in the external.  The further and further we find ourselves from\nthe inner riches of the psyche. The ego-Self axis is stretched to the\npoint that the ego feels very little connectedness with the psyche. Then\nthe Self which has a teleological purpose strives to alter this one\nsidedness and brings us into contact with some often unpleasant feelings\nlargely centered around the utter meaningless of our otherwise successful\nlives.  This compensation may result in a affective disorder such as\ndepression or anxiety around midlife. We suddenly thrust into a crippling\ndepression and cannot understand why because all is well on the outside.\nThe Self then brings us into greater contact with the rest of the psyche\nthrough powerful thoughts, unconscious symbols and somatic complaints. `}</p>\n    <p>{`If we interpret these experiences correctly, and heed the call of the\npsyche, the ego-Self axis retreats and the ego comes into greater contact\nwith the symbolic inner world. It is almost as though the ego became too\ncomplacent or too powerful and forgot its origins. As the ego lessens\nthis one-sided position, and meets the unconscious in a healthy way, the\nwhole psyche shifts and if all goes well, we go through the depression\nand gain the meaning that it contains. `}</p>\n    <p>{`What was the depression all about? Depression and anxiety at midlife are\nexamples of how the psyche tries to self-regulate and the Self is at the\nroot of this experience. When we are depressed we have cognitive\ndifficulties in that we can’t concentrate or recall so that our\noccupation becomes at risk. We have sleep difficulties and feel fatigued,\ndon’t want to engage in social activities or have fun. We just want to\nisolate ourselves in a dark room, unplug the phone, switch off the TV and\nstare at the wall.  All our normal distractions are dropped. We find\nourselves in this dark space alone, miserable and desperately unhappy. `}</p>\n    <p>{`So we now ask, what is the depression trying to lead us from and where\ndoes it want us to go?  The depression becomes teleological or purposeful\nin function forcing us to remove ourselves from the everyday, isolate and\nto think about what ails us? As we sit in that dark room and stare at the\nwall, we often think thoughts of the meaninglessness of our lives. We\nhear ourselves say “What’s the point of all this?” How can I have\nachieved so much yet be so unhappy? All these questions lead us to some\nconclusions. I’m living a one-sided life, feel disconnected from\nhumanity, and more importantly from myself. I know there is something\nbetter, a way to be that’s less painful. There is a more balanced life.\nIn these answers, we have the key.  The depression is forcing us to\nreexamine our lives, and take steps to change. The change is to work with\nthe psyche and access the inner riches of the unconscious. Once people\nstart making these changes they find the depression starts to subside.\nThe depression is functional and purposive - it is leading us away from\na state of psychic poverty to a more balanced life.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The same system can be applied to a state of anxiety.  There can be\na great danger in eliminating the symptoms of depression without asking\nwhat is at its core. You can antidepressants and feel better but this\nwould just be symptomatic. You may feel the inner restlessness that\nstarted the depression in the first place.  Staying in the depression and\nworking through it can bring immense relief (assuming the depression is\nnot life-threatening). `}</p>\n    <h4>{`Psychic Energy`}</h4>\n    <p>{`Psychic Energy or the libido can be thought of the energy involved in the\npsychodynamics of the psyche. We can imagine that all the processes in the\npsyche need energy to move. That energy is psychic energy.   `}</p>\n    <p><em parentName=\"p\">{`Jung`}</em>{`:`}</p>\n    <p>{`“An energy value which is able to communicate itself to any field of\nactivity whatsoever be it power, hunger, hatred, sexuality or religion\nwithout it every being itself a specific instinct. A kind of neutral\nenergy which is responsible for the formation of such symbols such as\nlight, fire, sun and the like.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`Jung used the words libido and psychic energy interchangeably.  This can\nbe confusing but for now realize we need psychic energy for the psyche to\ndo its work. `}</p>\n    <h4>{`Principles of psychic energy:`}</h4>\n    <p>{`Neutral, indestructible, follows a gradient, has an energetic amount or\nvalue, has a potential, can be blocked or channeled, obeys the laws of\nconservation and thermodynamics. Involves causality and finality,\noriginates in the unconscious,  and can progress and regress. `}</p>\n    <p>{`Neutral: it is not exclusively sexual as Freud suggested. It’s simply the\ngas needed in the psyche.  `}</p>\n    <p>{`Indestructible:  it cannot be destroyed only transformed into another\nstate in the psyche.  Does this mean we have a finite amount of psychic\nenergy? No although Jung originally thought so.  `}</p>\n    <p>{`Follows a gradient: It moves from a position of higher intensity to lower\nintensity.  `}</p>\n    <p>{`Has an energetic amount or value: We can theoretically imagine it has\na value to it. When an issue in the psyche has a very strong load or\nvalue to it, the psychic energy build up results in the need to move to\na lower level.  `}</p>\n    <p>{`It has a potential, and can be blocked or channelled: If we block psychic\nenergy, its builds up and seeks an outlet in other areas. Simple example\nis someone feeling a great deal of anxiety. A great deal of energy builds\nup - the psyche wants the person to run away from the scary situation but\ninstead the person becomes aggressive. The blocked energy is channeled\ninto aggression.  `}</p>\n    <p>{`Obeys the laws of conservation and thermodynamics: Based on the laws of\nthermodynamics in physics`}</p>\n    <p>{`Involves causality and finality: All psychic is directed toward\na particular endpoint (teleology) and is implicated in the causes of the\nsituation the psyche finds itself in. `}</p>\n    <p>{`Regression is a build up of psychic energy. `}</p>\n    <h3>{`Projection, Shadow, Anima/Animus`}</h3>\n    <h4>{`The Shadow`}</h4>\n    <p>{`The shadow represents the negative or unpleasant side of our psyche while\nthe anima/animus side represents the contrasexual side. `}</p>\n    <p>{`Why are these important? The shadow is often the early archetype we\nencounter early on in analysis. It is the repository of all we find\nunpleasant or shameful in ourselves and we try to hide from others. Until\nwe have come to terms with the shadow, we are at great risk of projecting\nthe shadow onto others or to act the shadow out and do mean and nasty\nthings to the people around us. This is why we have to meet the shadow\nand to understand it well. `}</p>\n    <h4>{`Anima or Animus`}</h4>\n    <p>{`This is the feminine side of a man and the masculine side of a woman.\nThese are important as they serve as the fundamental basis for our choice\nof partners in the outer world.  They also serve as links between\nconsciousness ( the outer world) and the inner world of the unconscious. `}</p>\n    <p><em parentName=\"p\">{`Jung`}</em>{`\n“The archetypes most clearly characterized from the empirical point of\nview are those that have the most frequent and most disturbing influence\nupon the ego.  These are the shadow, the anima and the animus. The most\naccessible of these and the easiest to experience is the shadow. For its\nnature can in large measure be inferred from the content of the personal\nunconscious.”  - Collected Works Part IX`}</p>\n    <h4>{`Projection`}</h4>\n    <p>{`The term projection is derived from classical psychoanalysis (Freud) and\nis regarded as a primitive ego defense mechanism. `}</p>\n    <p>{`An operation whereby qualities, feelings, wishes or even objects which\nthe subject refuses to recognize or rejects in himself are expelled from\nthe self and located in the another person or thing.`}</p>\n    <p><em parentName=\"p\">{`Jung`}</em></p>\n    <p>{`“Projection means  the expulsion of subjective content into an object. It\nis the opposite of introjection in that it is a process of dissimulation\nin which a subject of content becomes alienated from the subject and is so\nto speak embodied in the object.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`Both definitions are structured in a similar way. Projection is a process\nor an operation in which subjective content such as qualities, feelings,\nwishes or even objects which an individual cannot recognize in him or\nherself are expelled and then located in another person or thing. `}</p>\n    <p>{`A key term: whatever is rejected or expelled is unconscious.  We don’t\nknow we are doing this and we seldom know what it is that is being\nprojected. Projection is a very natural process in the psyche.  We\nproject all the time especially when dealing with other people. `}</p>\n    <p>{`Do you remember meeting someone for the first time and they felt familiar\nas though you knew them from before? As your conversation went on, you\nstarted to see that they spoke or behaved just like someone you already\nknow say a sibling or an acquaintance.  Then you began to realize that\nyou expected them to hold certain attitudes or beliefs. Or you found\nyourself distancing yourself from the other person because you already\nknow they held in terms of beliefs and you don’t like these beliefs. You\nfound some of their attitudes unattractive. This was projection. Very\nlittle of the real information about this new person was actually present\nin this interaction as most of it came from within you.  `}</p>\n    <p>{`An excellent summary of our definition is offered by Andrew Samuels:\n“Jung’s approach to projection builds upon a psychoanalytical base.\nProjection may be seen as normal or pathological and as a defense against\nanxiety. Difficult emotions and unacceptable parts of the personality may\nbe located in a person or object external to the subject. The problematic\ncontent is thereby controlled and the individual feels a release and\na sense of well being. In analytical psychology, stress has also been\nlain upon projection as the means by which the contents of the inner\nworld are made available to ego consciousness.  The assumption is that an\nencounter between the ego and such unconscious contents is of value. The\nexternal world of persons and things serves the internal world by\nprovided the raw material to be activated by projection.  This can be\nseen most clearly when one what is projected is also representative of\na part of the psyche. Anima and animus projections are carried by real\nmen and women. Without the carrier there would be no meeting. Similarly,\nthe shadow is frequently encountered in projection.  By definition the\nshadow is the repository of what is unacceptable to consciousness. It is\ntherefore ripe for projection. For anything of value to be gained though\nit is necessary for some reintegration or recollection of that which is\nprojected to take place. “`}</p>\n    <p>{`There a definite stages that we engage in when we project. When we become\naware of the discrepancy between the real person and the projections we\nmake onto that real person, we are starting to withdraw our projections.\nThis means that we are seeing the person for whom he or she really is and\nnot using them as a movie theater screen to project our movies onto. `}</p>\n    <p>{`This is a way to understand projection. That of a movie screen.  It is\nalmost as if when we meet someone and start to project we are treating\nthem like a movie screen a blank canvas that we then fill with images\nfrom a movie that the unconscious generates about this person. Although\nnone of the projections are based on hard core facts, the are psychically\nreal. `}</p>\n    <h4>{`The Shadow`}</h4>\n    <p>{`The very name gives us a key to what we are dealing with: something in\nthe shadows, something not quite in the light; something dark. `}</p>\n    <p><em parentName=\"p\">{`Jung`}</em></p>\n    <p>{`“A closer examination of the dark characteristics, that is the\ninferiorities constituting the shadow, reveals that they have an emotional\nnature, a kind of autonomy and accordingly and a obsessive or better\npossessive quality.”  Collected Works IX II `}</p>\n    <p>{` The shadow is highly emotionally loaded with a life of its own at times.\nWe know this because of what happens when we begin to project the shadow.\nIt feels as though it takes us over for a little while. `}</p>\n    <p>{` Try this exercise: Think of someone the same gender as you are. Someone\nwho you really dislike. Someone who’s habits and behaviors are quite\ndisgusting to you.  Someone who really irritates you with their behavior.\nList the qualities that they have that you dislike:`}</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`Selfish`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`Lacks compassion`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`Judgmental`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`Mean `}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`Rejects -Hate for the other`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`Lacks a moral compass`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`Vindictive`}</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>{`This person is a real, living walking example of your shadow.  The\nqualities that you dislike about them so much are your own qualities: the\nqualities of your shadow.  You have met your shadow and it is you.\nFeeling a little uncomfortable right now? You and I both know that you\nkeep these qualities to yourself, very well hidden because if people knew\nabout your shadow side, they would never want to be around you. `}</p>\n    <p><em parentName=\"p\">{`Jung`}</em></p>\n    <p>{`“Though the shadow is a motif that is well known to mythology, as anima\nand animus, it represents first and foremost the personal unconscious and\nits contents can therefore be made conscious without too much difficulty.\nIn this it differs from anima and animus for as the shadow can be seen\nand recognized fairly easily, the anima and the animus are much farther\naway from consciousness. In normal circumstances are seldom if ever\nrealized. With a little self-criticism, one can see through the shadow so\nfar as its nature is personal. But, when it appears as an archetype, one\nencounters the same difficulties as with the anima and animus. In other\nwords, it is quite within the bounds of possibility for a man to\nrecognize that relatively evil side of his nature but it is a rare and\nshattering experience to gaze into the face of absolute evil.“`}</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`Collective Works XI II `}</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>{`We can think of the shadow as a complex. Recall that complexes are the\nstructures we find within the personal unconscious.  We can imagine the\ncomplex to have three layers almost like an onion.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The outer layer is the personal shadow.  The middle layer is the cultural\nshadow, the core or inner part is the archetype of the shadow.  Remember\ncomplexes belong to the personal unconscious and archetypes belong to the\ncollective unconscious.  So this core of the complex contains an\narchetype that is connected to the archetype in the collective\nunconscious.  `}</p>\n    <p>{`The first layer of the shadow is built up with all of experiences with\nthe darker part of life. As an infant we get early messages from our\nparents certain behaviors are bad or naughty. We try to stop these\nbehaviors but they all wind up adding to this first layer of the shadow\ncomplex in the form of the personal shadow. So this layer is composed of\nall the nasty or shameful parts of yourself that you prefer no one else\nknows about. Your spitefulness, your bigotry, your racism, your cruelty,\netc… `}</p>\n    <p><em parentName=\"p\">{`Jung`}</em></p>\n    <p>{`The shadow “ is the thing the person has no wish to be.”`}</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`Collected Works XVI `}</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>{`The next layer is the cultural shadow. Think of how the society you grew\nup in has a dark side. A side in which people are discriminated against,\npersecuted. Your cultural shadow is the manner in which Native Americans\nhave been stripped of their lands, their language, and their culture.\nAnother cultural shadow in the wholesale degradation of the natural world\n(clear cutting of the forests for example).  All societies have a dark\nside. `}</p>\n    <p>{`The inner layer is the shadow archetype. We know this archetype well as\nwe have seen the archetypal image that derives from it in a variety of\nplaces. For example, people raised in the Christian religion know that\nthe devil is the embodiment of the archetypal shadow. We often tend to\nthink of historical figures as being the embodiment of the archetypal\nshadow: people such as Hitler or Stalin. If we consider what these\nindividuals did in their time, we can understand they enacted something\nbeyond simple bigotry; something far more powerful than simple\ndiscrimination. They enacted archetypal forces of the shadow. The\nholocaust is a horrific example of just how terrifying the archetypal\nshadow can be.  What is very important in our understanding of the shadow\nis how well we actually know it.    Jung was clear that we could never\neliminate the shadow but only come to terms with it. There is a very good\nreason why we cannot eliminate the shadow. At the core of the shadow\ncomplex is an archetype. The archetype of the shadow and we are not able\nto alter our archetypes, only to become more conscious of their impact on\nthe rest of the psyche. This means that we know what our shadow qualities\nare, cringe whenever we think about these qualities but endeavor not to\nenact them on others.  As Luke Skywalker finds in Star Wars, the evil we\nsee around us is within us too. This means that if we are conscious of\nour shadow, we are also far less prone to project the shadow onto others,\nand even better,  we have an less tendency to enact the shadow.  `}</p>\n    <h4>{`The Anima and the Animus`}</h4>\n    <p><em parentName=\"p\">{`Samuels`}</em></p>\n    <p>{`“The inner figure of woman held by a man and the figure of man at work in\na woman’s psyche” `}</p>\n    <p>{`The anima exists in a man and the animus in a woman.  Don’t make the\ncommon mistake we all do when we begin Jungian Psychology in thinking\nthey both exist in a man or a woman. They are archetypal images and they\nare not available immediately to consciousness.  Both are of vital\nimportance to the psyche’s functioning but because they are unconscious,\nthey can also be projected.  `}</p>\n    <p><em parentName=\"p\">{`Samuels`}</em></p>\n    <p>{` “They act as a psychopomp or guides of soul and they can become necessary\nlinks with creative possibilities and instruments of individuation.\nBecause of their archetypal connections anima and animus have been\nrepresented in many collective forms and figures. As Aphrodite, Athena,\nHelen of Troy, Mary, Sapientia, and Beatrice, or as Hermes, Apollo,\nHercules, Alexander the Great or Romeo. In projection they are attract\nattention and emotional fervor as public figures but also as friends,\nlovers, commonplace and ordinary wives and husbands. We meet them as\nconsorts in our dreams. As personified components of psyche they connect\nand involve us with life. ” `}</p>\n    <p>{` The idea of personification is really important to our model. We tend to\nproject a sense of otherness in other words as a man I project the\npersonification of the anima onto women. Because this personification is\nquite other to me, it is not me in its form. So as a man the otherness is\nprojected as female. For a woman this otherness is projected as male. In\nso doing, the anima and animus act as mediators between the ego and\nconsciousness and the unconscious. These two archetypes are contentious\nissues in our day. When Jung published his ideas, being a man of his time\nhe wrote about these two archetypes in a very stereotyped fashion. And it\nis this manner of writing that has led to the controversy. Whether you\nagree with the constructs or not, start with beginning to understand them\nin terms of the psychodynamics of the psyche. Once you consider yourself\nfluent in their use, then go a little further and try to find alternative\nways to represent otherness in the psyche.  If you are interested in this\nmaterial, great book “Jung, a feminist revision”. `}</p>\n    <p>{` One of the core issues in the anima and the animus is that one can be\ngripped by these powerful images and this may cause an alteration in your\nbehavior.  `}</p>\n    <p><em parentName=\"p\">{`Samuels`}</em></p>\n    <p>{`“Possession by either anima or animus transforms a personality in such\na way as to give prominence to those traits which are seen as being\npsychologically characteristic of the opposite sex.   Either way a person\nloses individuality first of all and then in either case both charm and\nvalues. In a man he becomes dominated by anima and eros principles with\nconnotations of restlessness, promiscuity, moodiness, sentimentality,\nwhatever could be described as unconstrained emotionality. A woman subject\nto the authority of the animus and logos is managerial, obstinate,\nruthless and domineering. Both become one-sided. He is seduced by inferior\npeople and forms meaningless attachments. She being taken in by second\nrate thinking, marches forward under the banner of unrelated convictions.“`}</p>\n    <p>{`You can see just from this very loaded language that these constructs are\nhot topics in analytical psychology.  We also note from the above quote\nwhat would happen to us if we are dominated by the anima or the animus. `}</p>\n    <p>{`Let’s try a quick experiment:`}</p>\n    <p>{`Think of your ideal partner. So for a straight male imagine the ideal\nwoman. What would she look like?  How tall is she? What does her body, her\nhair and her skin look like? How does she behave? What does she do for\na living? How is she in bed? How does she comfort you when you are having\na bad day? Is she strong and dominant or more submissive? Does she write\npoetry or paint? Is she good enough to be the mother of your children? Now\nthat you have this ideal woman in your mind, realize that you have just\npersonified aspects of your anima. `}</p>\n    <p>{`For a straight woman imagine the ideal man.  Do the same thing. What does\nhe look like? How tall is he? What does his body, skin and hair look\nlike? Is he strong or is he weak? Does he protect you or lead the way?\nDoes he initiate activities? Is he nurturing and communicative or silent\nand deep?  How is he in bed? What does he do when you feel upset or\nscared after a hard day at work?  This ideal male is a personification of\nthe animus.   `}</p>\n    <p>{`Jung: Collective Work XI under definitions. `}</p>\n    <h3>{`The Persona`}</h3>\n    <p><em parentName=\"p\">{`Samuels`}</em></p>\n    <p>{`The term derived from the latin word for the mask actors wore in\nclassical times. Hence, persona refers to the mask or face a person puts\non to confront the world. Persona can refer to gender identity, or\na stage of development such as adolescence, a social status, a job or\nprofession. Over a lifetime many personas will be worn and several may be\ncombined at any one moment.`}</p>\n    <p>{`What does this mean for you and I? We all have at least one persona. More\nlikely, we have far more than that. Often our person is based on\nsomething we do or are expected to do in society such as being an\nemployee, or lawyer or a supporter of a football team. When we are in\nthis role, we tend to act in ways that are consistent with how others are\nexpected to view us. As the lawyer, we may always  try to be arrodite or\nwise.  As a football team supporter, we wear particular team colors,\nassemble with other supporters and are often loud in public. All the time\nwe are acting out a persona. I find it useful to pay attention to not\nonly what we are doing in terms of our behaviour, but also what clothes\nwe wear, how we speak and especially what we actually say and think. Very\nimportant here is to note that we have to have a persona. Without it, we\nare naked in the world and have nothing between us and (the ego)  and the\nexternal world (the unconscious). We have nothing to hide behind, no\nclear sense of how to act, or what to wear or what to say. So you can see\nyou have to have a persona. `}</p>\n    <p>{`Those poor souls who have weak personas suffer tremendously in the world\nbecause they don’t know who to be in any particular moment and feel that\npeople can see right through them and that they have no defenses. I often\nthink of persona as a form of defense against the world. Remember when we\nwere small, how we didn’t really care what the grown ups thought of us.\nWe just wanted to play and to have some fun. We had very basic personas\nand these personas were not consciously chosen. They just developed out\nof the psyche. We were known as a serious little child or a very\nboisterous little girl.  But at the end of the day, we really didn’t care\nso long as we could have fun and to play. What makes small children so\nendearing to us is not only their ability to move between reality and\nplay (or the conscious and the unconscious worlds)  but also how they\ndon’t have strong personas so we are able to see the real child at all\ntimes. `}</p>\n    <p>{`This is so different when we are adults as we learn to persona up and not\nlet our guard down. As we grew older and went to school at around five or\nsix, we suddenly realized that certain kids like certain behaviours and\nwe started to act out these behaviors. Here is where we consciously began\nto adjust our personas and started to realize that we can have more than\none. We can have a persona for inside the classroom, one for recess, and\none for home. As we progress through school we really started to work on\nour personas. Because we know that this is the way to ensure our\nfriendships and connections with other kids at school.  Then puberty sets\nin and the young adolescent finds themselves in quite a pickle because\nnow we aren’t really sure which personas really work.  We then go to\nextremes often first with the external quality persona of our clothing.\nAll of these are attempts to find an identity. The persona is crucial in\nthis process. `}</p>\n    <p>{`One of the functions of the ego is to provide stability of identity and\npersonality over time. The persona is involved in this process. Remember\nthose times when having the right clothes was really really important?\nHow you had to get the right bicycle or the right toy? Nowadays this must\nbe really difficult for adolescents as they not only have adjust their\ninternal way of being, but have to be aware of rapidly changing trends in\nclothing. Which brand is in and which one is out. Or which video game\nconsole is more trendy and which one isn’t. Even worse, which cell phone\nor web service we should use. All of this contributes to the rapid\ndevelopment and alteration of the persona. When you next see adolescents\non the street or in your home, and you shake your head or their strange\nclothing or body piercing or language remember that all they are trying\nto do is to test out which persona works for them.  Those of you that\nhave been through this with your own children know that very shortly the\nextreme behaviors and clothing will end and your kids develop a fairly\nconsistent persona which involves not only what to wear but also what\nsubjects to take at school, what music to listen to, and which friends to\nkeep.`}</p>\n    <p>{`As we finish our schooling or university life, and head out into careers,\nwe know that each particular career has a specific persona. We soon\nrealize from watching role models in our chosen profession, how we are\nsupposed to behave. What to drink, what to eat and what to wear.  But\nmost importantly, what way to act in the company of others.  This can be\nquite daunting at first. How is a lawyer, doctor, or a dentist supposed\nto act? Not only in their consulting room but out in the company of\nothers. We tend to develop particular personas through identifying with\nroles models already in these professions. `}</p>\n    <p>{`I’m sure you know people who stay in their professional persona all the\ntime. If you have a doctor friend and that person is always acting the\ndoctor, dispensing advice at dinner parties or other social gatherings,\nyou can see that he or she is stuck in their persona. After a while it\nbecomes really irritating and you want to shake them up and say “Just be\nreal!” `}</p>\n    <p>{`There is a strong risk that we over identify with our persona. This leads\nto one-sidedness (something we touched on earlier) and a great deal of\ntrouble in later life. But equally problematic is someone who changes\ntheir persona too often. If we see them at work they are so different\nfrom at a party or at the theatre or at the a game. We get confused with\nwhom we are dealing. And we want to go up to these folks and give them\na shake too and say “Just be consistent!” `}</p>\n    <p>{`Jung saw the persona as an archetype. In all humans there is a need to\nengage with other people in a variety of settings. So a klan chief had to\nact in a certain way. The young males and females were expected to act in\nequally defined ways. We know that even in our massive societal\nstructures, we need people to behave in certain ways. Meaning we need\nthem to stay in a certain persona that is consistent with their function,\noffice or occupation. We get shocked when we hear of people acting\noutside of their role. So if we hear of a police arrested for drunk\ndriving, it bothers us far more than some nameless person arrested for\nthe same thing. We expect our judges to be wise and never to display\ninstinctual or irrational behavior. So if a judge makes a statement from\nthe bench that is inconsistent with that role, we find it troubling and\noften want that judge to resign his or her position. The same can be said\nfor teach, a doctor , a priest, or any other such occupation for that\nmatter. Isn’t is interesting that we all seem to have a fairly consistent\ncultural expectation of occupational personas. These personas often vary\nacross cultures but within cultures we all have a solid sense of what is\nexpected of how particular personas should be displayed in public.  `}</p>\n    <p>{`If we look at how comics often lampoon politicians in public it is so\ninteresting to see how they often choose behaviors or actions that vastly\nopposite from their public personas. It is when we over identify with\na persona where we land in trouble because what happens when the ego over\nidentifies with a rigid persona, is that the unconscious tends to burst\ninto consciousness in severe and unpredictable ways.  `}</p>\n    <p>{`For example, if we think back to the people in a clinical setting\nI described in episode three, which I called the model of the psyche, we\nhad an over identification with the persona and severe depression\nresulted. This is an example of the compensatory nature of the psyche.\nWhen things are too heavily weighted in one area of the psyche, say the\npersona, the unconscious tends to load up with psychic energy and at some\npoint a massive unloading results in unconscious material erupting into\nconsciousness. Often this eruption is in a severe affective disorder such\nas depression or anxiety or may even result in somatization. `}</p>\n    <p>{`You can see why this aspect of the model outlined earlier is so important\nto our psychodynamic understanding of the psyche.  The same lack of\nbalance exists in individual who has a very weak persona. You may\nencounter these individuals and they seem to need to exist in their own\nfantasy world, their own inner world which on the face of it is a good\nthing as we all need to encounter and confront the unconscious, but if we\nretreat into the unconscious too far, we really struggle to keep one foot\nin the external ego based world and the other in the internal unconscious\nworld. `}</p>\n    <p>{`Overall we need the persona to be a compliment for the workings of  the\npsyche. The ego is vital in this relationship because if it is rigidly\nidentified with the persona, it is an ego that looks outwards only;\noutwards into the external world and is quite blind to the inner world of\nthe unconscious.  Patients in this stage may say oh I haven’t had a dream\nfor years. We know this cannot be the case as we all dream every night.\nIt’s just that we don’t recall our dreams. These patients as they begin\ntheir work in analysis and start to recognize their unconscious often\nfind themselves having intense dreams each night that they are able to\nrecall. It is almost as if the ego which we need to help us to recall\ndreams each night suddenly looks over its back and says oh yeah\nI remember that stuff. All that stuff about the unconscious and dreams\nand symbols - I haven’t seen that side of myself since I was very small.\nThis is a way for us to see that when we pay attention to the inner\nworld, and begin to lessen our excessive attention to the outer world,\na balancing or compensatory action in the psyche is stimulated. So the\npersona is a mediator between the external world of others and the ego.\nIt can be thought of as a defense for the ego.  The anima and animus are\nmediators between the internal world and the ego.  The persona and the\nanima or animus can be thought of as opposites. They fulfill very\nopposite roles. For the persona dealing with external world and the ego,\nand the anima/animus dealing with the ego and the internal world. Both\nare critical in the process of adaptation. `}</p>\n    <h3>{`Enantiodromia`}</h3>\n    <p>{`Greek word meaning running contrary-wise or things turn into their\nopposite.  This refers in part to an aspect of compensation. `}</p>\n    <p>{`Example (joke): regular old boring accountant who slogs away at his\nbusiness for years, neglects his wife and kids and lives a very sterile\nlife. Then in mid-life suddenly looks up from his desk at his young\nassistant, tells her to grab her passport , buys a red sports car and\ndrives away with her to Mexico where he acts out his new lust for life.\nThen, six weeks later he come back to his wife and family terribly\nashamed because he finally realizes what he has done and what he has\nneglected all his adult life: the world of the symbolic, the relatedness\nbetween his conscious and unconscious and between himself and other\npeople in the world .`}</p>\n    <p>{`This is enantiodromia. From this serious, sterile persona identified\naccountant to the wreckless playboy.  He has turned into his opposite.\nJung felt this word represents a principle in the psyche in which\neventually, everything turns into its opposite. Because we know something\nabout psychic energy from earlier we can speak of enantiodromia in a more\npsychodynamic way. If an extreme one-sided way exists in consciousness,\npsychic energy has to balance this one-sided position. This means that\npsychic energy loads up in the unconscious to balance out the ego stance.\nFinally, this intense psychic energy in the unconscious  breaks through\nand erupts into consciousness with all the concomitant problems. `}</p>\n    <p>{`This eruption takes the form of dreams, intense affects or more seriously\nstrong somatic reactions. We will soon turn to interpretation of dreams.\nWe now have and strong enough understanding of psychodynamic processes\nand structures to begin to make sense of dreams from a Jungian\nperspective. `}</p>\n    <p>{`There is another process that we need to review before we launch into\ndreams: the difference between a symbol and a sign and how to expand or\namplify a symbol. `}</p>\n    <h3>{`Signs`}</h3>\n    <p>{`What exactly is a sign and how does it differ from a symbol? A sign is\nsomething with a fixed meaning. This meaning is culturally or universally\nunderstood even though there might be slight variations across cultures.\nAn example of a sign is the octagonal red sign we use for a traffic stop\nsign. It has only one meaning - that of bring your vehicle to a complete\nhalt just before this red sign. It doesn’t mean drive through, yield or\nbuy a hamburger or fries.  In pretty much all cultures the same sign, the\nstop sign, is used to mean the same thing.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Another sign would be the red exit sign that we see above the exit door\nin a movie theatre or in an office.  It only means leave this place\nthrough the door. It is often red in color so that we can all see it in\nan emergency. Most if not all of us know that in an emergency you need to\nexit at this place. `}</p>\n    <p>{`So a sign is a word, a shape or an object that has a single, fixed\nmeaning.  Here is where we run into some difficulties when we speak of\nsymbols and signs. In classical Freudian psychoanalysis will know that\nmany of the objects that Freud interpreted in dreams say hills or tunnels\nor apples of bananas were referred to in a way that made them signs.  The\napple equals the female breast in Freudian dream interpretation or the\nbanana means the male penis. One sign has one meaning. So it is quite\nincorrect from a Jungian perspective to interpret dream imagery in fixed\nways. From this perspective, stay away from those dreadful dream\ndictionaries you find at bookstores that tell you if you dreamt of an\napple it means a breast or any other such fixed meaning. These dreams\nshould be called dream sign dictionaries and not dream symbol\ndictionaries. `}</p>\n    <h3>{`Symbols`}</h3>\n    <p>{`How do signs differ from symbols?  A crucial difference is that a symbol\ndoes not have a fixed, singular meaning. Jung, in dealing with the\ndifference between Freudian sign interpretation and his own symbol\ninterpretation said the following:`}</p>\n    <p>{`“The true symbol differs essentially from this and should be understood\nas an intuitive idea that cannot yet be formulated in any other or better\nway.“`}</p>\n    <p>{`“A symbol always presupposes that the chosen expression is the best\npossible description or formulation of a relatively unknown fact. Which\nis nonetheless known to exist or is postulated as existing.”  Collective\nWorks XI`}</p>\n    <p>{`This leaves us in some difficulty. How then do we know what a symbol\nmeans?  What if I get it wrong and say it means something completely\ndifferent from someone else? In this situation you are quite safe because\nyou know what a symbol means to you better than anyone else. Because you\nget a meaning about a symbol from your own unconscious; your own\nfeelings, and your own experiences.  Example:  say you dreamt of a horse.\nYou told your dream to a friend and began to explain the meaning of\na horse. In other words you begin to enlarge on the meaning of the\nsymbol. As a child you may have been thrown from a horse and broken your\narm, and never ridden one since. You may dislike and fear horses as\na result and find the appearance of a horse symbol in your dream to be\nscary and threatening.  The meaning of the horse symbol to you is very\nnegative. Your friend on the other hand, may have been raised on a cattle\nranch and spent many hours of his childhood on the back of a horse\nrounding up cattle. He may have had a favorite horse that he trained and\nrode for the years that he spent at home on the ranch. To him, the horse\nis a solid, powerful, dependable creature that help do his ranch chores,\nwas his good friend and helped him get through some difficult terrain or\ntimes. The horse symbol for him is one of a positive, loyal, dependable\nfriend. This is quite different to your meaning of the horse. Which one\nis wrong  on the meaning of the horse symbol? This answer is neither. You\nare both absolutely correct as you are developing a meaning of the horse\nsymbol from your actual lived experience.  `}</p>\n    <p>{`The meaning of a symbol becomes accurate largely from your own\nexperience. Symbol dictionaries are best used to see the more universal\naspects of a symbols meaning.  You are the best symbol dictionary in the\nworld. As you rely on your own psyche to provide the meaning. This isn’t\nwhere it all ends. All we have really done is develop are personal\nassociations to the symbol.  From this association we do need to enlarge\nthis symbol by tapping into its more universal nature. As images are such\npowerful images and exist in the collective unconscious, we need to see\nhow different cultures attribute meaning to a different symbol. This\nmeans that the core meaning of a symbols is the same across cultures, but\neach culture will add something specific to its own cultural meaning of\na symbol.  Here the symbol dictionary is useful. `}</p>\n    <h3>{`Amplification`}</h3>\n    <p><em parentName=\"p\">{`Samuels`}</em></p>\n    <p>{`Amplification involves use of mythic, historical and cultural parallels in\norder to clarify and make ample the metaphorical content of dream\nsymbolism. `}</p>\n    <p><em parentName=\"p\">{`Jung`}</em></p>\n    <p>{`The psychological tissue in which the image is embedded. Amplification\nenables the dreamer to abandon a purely personal and individualistic\nattitude toward the dream image. It emphasizes a metaphorical hence\napproximate rather than a literal translation of dream content and\nprepares the dreamer to exercise choice. This is done by acknowledging\nwhat is most immediately relevant for the dreamer and then allowing for\nfurther understanding as a consequence of reflection. `}</p>\n    <p>{` An additional possibility, though one not specifically formulated by\nJung,  is that by way of amplification one consciously experiences\noneself within and as part of archetypal energies rather than as their\nobject. `}</p>\n    <p>{` This refers to enlarging our personal meaning of a dream using the\nprocess of amplification. So what we are actually doing in the process of\namplification is focusing our attention on the archetypal image that the\nsymbol is and going beyond our own associations to the same image. There\nis something greater to the symbol of the horse than simply saying it is\nthe thing that threw me and caused me to break my arm.  The first part of\nour work in interpreting a symbol was to develop personal associations to\nthat symbol. The next phase is to develop universal meaning of the\nsymbol, but there is a serious danger in symbol amplification of becoming\noverly intellectual. The key here is to do the research required for the\namplification but to stay with the material that grips your attention. As\nsoon as you find yourself reading about some arcane symbol meaning, in\nsome specific culture you don’t feel anything anymore for the symbol, you\nknow you’ve gone too far. This is especially so in amplifying your dream\nsymbols.  The symbols that you have in your dream are yours and are their\nfor a very specific reason. So amplify only until you feel the symbol\nbegins to lose its value or energy.  Don’t thrash a symbol to death in\namplifying it,  just add something that really peaks your interest or has\nspecific relevance to your dream or to your life. This is a very\ndifficult thing to do as we are all used to overworking the meaning of\nsymbols when we begin this process.  `}</p>\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
