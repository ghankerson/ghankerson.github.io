The
subsequent development of culture is called history.</p><p>Three revolutions shaped history:</p><ul><li>The cognitive revolution 70,000 years ago</li><li>The agricultural revolution 12,000 years ago.</li><li>The scientific revolution 500 years ago. </li></ul><p>Animals like humans appeared 2.5 million years ago, but they did not stand
out from other animals in significant ways. </p><p>Definition of species: animals that mate with each other and produce
offspring.</p><p>Species that evolve from a common ancestor are part of the same genus.
Lions, tigers and panthers are part of the genus <em>Panthera</em>. </p><p>Homo Sapiens are part of the genus Homo and species <em>Sapien</em>. That means
that in the past there were other kinds of humans.  </p><p>Genera (plural of genus) are grouped into families. 6 million years ago
a single female ape produced offspring that became ancestors to chimps and
humans. </p><h2>Skeletons in the Closet</h2><p>The first humans appeared about 2.5 million years ago from an earlier
group of apes called Australopithecus (southern ape). About 2 million
years ago some of these ancient humans left their homeland and settled in
North Africa, Europe and Asia. </p><p>In Europe and Western Asia they evolved into <em>Homo neanderthalensis</em>.</p><p>In eastern Asia they became <em>Home erectus</em> and survived for 2 million
years. </p><p>On the island of Java in Indonesia the evolved into <em>Home soloenis</em>.</p><p>On the small island of Flores they evolved into a small human species
called <em>Homo florensis</em> due to a resource poor environment.</p><p>In Siberia they became <em>Home denisova</em> and was just discovered in 2010.  </p><p>In East Africa humans continued to evolve into <em>Homo rudolfensis</em>. <em>Homo
sapien</em> means &quot;wise man&quot;. </p><p>Human species did not evolve in a linear way as <em>rudolfensis</em> showed.</p><h2>The Cost of Thinking</h2><p>Mammals weighing 130 pounds have an average brain size of 12 cubic inches.
The earliest human 2.5 million years ago had brain sizes of 36 cubic
inches. Modern Sapiens have brain sizes of 73-85 cubic inches.  </p><p>Large brains are a drain on the body. They account for 25% of energy use
even at rest. It&#x27;s only 8% for other apes. This required more time in
search of food and caused atrophy of muscles.</p><p>Humans also walk upright. This frees up hands for using tools, signaling
and weapons. We paid for this with back aches, earlier and more painful
births, and longer childhood dependency.</p><p>This also required multiple adults to help rear children and gather food.</p><p><em>Homo sapien</em> children are also capable of being shaped to a culture and
more learning.</p><p>Early humans despite the ability to use tools and other cognitive
abilities, they lived in fear of predators. They specialized in extracting
bone marrow from carcasses that other predators were finished with. We
were in the middle of the food chain. Only in the last 100,000 years did
we jump to the top.  This happened very quickly from an evolutionary
perspective and humans upset a delicate ecological balance. </p><h2>A Race of Cooks</h2><p><em>Home erectus</em> and Neanderthals were using fire on a daily basis 300,000
years ago. Fire may have allowed burning the neighborhood to make thick
forests into prime grassland as well as find harvest cooked animal, nuts
and tubers.</p><p>Most importantly fire allowed cooking. It killed parasites and germs as
well as making other kinds of food like nuts easier to chew.  It also
allowed humans to spend less time and energy digesting. Some scholars
believe this allowed a shortened intestinal track and brain growth. Humans
for the first time now derived power from something other than their
physical size and strength.  This separated us from other animals.
A single person could use the power of fire to burn down a forest. It gave
us smaller teeth and jaws as well.</p><h2>Our Brothers&#x27; Keeper</h2><p>As of 70,000 years ago <em>Homo sapiens</em> started to migrate from east Africa
and overrun other kinds of humans. </p><p>There are 2 theories on why. </p><ol><li>Interbreeding Theory that Sapiens mixed with other human races. </li><li>Replacement theory that Sapiens replaced other humans by either being
better at finding and consuming resources or by killing other humans
off en mass. </li></ol><p>The later theory had been winning the day until it was discovered 1-4% of
European and Middle Eastern DNA is Neanderthal. 6 percent of Australian
DNA is Denoivan.</p><p>So current thought is that it is a combination of both but more the
latter.</p><p>About 50,000 years Sapiens and other kinds of humans started to diverge to
the point where they could not produce offspring together.</p><p>Other human species started to vanish between 12,000 and 50,000 years ago.</p><p>The most likely answer to why Sapiens were successful is language.</p><nav class="PrevNext_prev_next__3uyX5"><h2 class="PrevNext_hdg2__AiWTE">Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind</h2><ul class="PrevNext_list__RKtDj"><li><h3 class="PrevNext_hdg3__2IZIN">Currently Reading</h3>An
