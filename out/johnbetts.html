Analyst</a></p><p>Listen to Dr. Betts podcast at the link above if you want a great primer
on Jung. I can&#x27;t recommend it enough. </p><p>Psyche is the totality of all psychic processes conscious and
unconscious. Conscious plus unconscious plus body equals psyche.  Jung
does not divide the mind and body. We may experience the psyche
consciously (like an idea), unconsciously (like a dream) or somatically
(in the body like anxiety over an upcoming exam). </p><p>The unconscious is made of all of our memories whether we can recall them or
not, all material not available to the conscious, and all repressed material. </p><p>Jung expressed the unconscious negatively in that the unconscious is all that
is not in conscious.   </p><p>In an opographical diagram, Jung’s model contains the conscious, the
personal unconscious, the collective unconscious and the body.</p><h2>Part I The first layer is the conscious</h2><h3>The structure of the conscious is the ego  which has five functions.</h3><ol><li>Stability of personality: My personality remains reasonably stable over
time. It would be difficult to relate to others if our personality changes
frequently.  Likewise it would be very difficult if our friends and family’s
personality changed frequently.  It would be very difficult to relate to
them. </li><li>Stability  of identity over time: Self awareness and self identity is
stable over time. We know who we are, what we like and dislike, and
what we stand for. When you look in the mirror at night you know you
will still be yourself in the morning. Your identity did not change
while you were asleep. Movies show us that a lack of stability of
identity is deeply troubling.  In the Bourne Identity, Jason Bourne
cannot remember who he is and what he stands for after a trauma. He
spends the rest of the movie working this out.
</li><li>Cognition: The ability to process information, problem solve and store
memory. If you see a friend, you remember who they are, what they like and
dislike and what bothers them. You remember their shared experiences. Severe
depression is a disorder that limits our ability to think through issues, to
concentrate, and remember is impacted so we feel isolated.</li><li>Executive function: The ability to deal with everyday life and the
demands of the world. For example, we know that we should put
toothpaste on the toothbrush before we brush our teeth not after. We do
thousands of these tasks daily. Aging friends or family who sink into
dimensia show how important this function this is. They get lost in
their own house and have trouble getting dressed. </li><li>Reality Testing: The line between conscious and unconscious is more
blurry than we would believe. Ego performs reality testing to help us
with. It is the ability to expect and obey the laws of physics. For
example we know to open the car door before we get out of the car. We
take the elevator to the ground floor of a building not just fly or
jump. We need this function to get through the day. People who suffer
from psychotic disorder lose this ability. They think they can fly from
the fifteenth floor.  </li></ol><h3>The second layer of Jung’s model of is the personal unconscious.</h3><p>The part of the unconscious we can mostly access. It is unique to the
individual. It structure is made of  complexes. A complex is clusters of
feeling turned associations around a common theme. </p><h4>The Money Complex Example</h4><p>We all have experiences of money. Starting from an early age when we are
given some coins as a gift. We don’t understand  what these coins are, but
we know they are important from the way adults talk about money. We hear
phrases like “Don’t spend it all in one place”, and “Money doesn’t grow on
trees”. As we get older we realize we can purchase things with money. We
go to the store and buy candy and begin to understand money has powerful
significance. We may hear parents argue about money. We want something
only to be told it’s too expensive.  Later we start to earn money and
realize a small sum of money requires a lot of hard work.  We hear about
banks, interest, and taxes and start to understand money is central to
this world. As we start to work and pay bills perhaps we run out of money.  </p><p>Each of these experiences has a strong feeling attached. These feelings
turned association cluster together to create a complex.  The same thing
can happen with the father complex, mother complex, competence and many
others.  We all have many complexes. </p><p>So what? Well when we are triggered by a specific complex that lives in
our personal unconscious can come up into consciousness and make us behave
contrary to our everyday personality. One of the functions of ego is
stability of personality over time. When we complex out, the ego takes
a beating from the complex and suffers reduced ability to operate
appropriately. The complex takes over for a short time. When this happens,
others may say we behaved in a strange way. What they are saying is our
normal personality behavior dropped off the radar for a time.  Another
personality popped up in its place. Nobody really likes that new person.</p><p>A complex when triggered impacts the ego’s functioning. Jung - “Everyone
knows people have complexes. What is more important is complexes have
people.” Here he is talking about archetypes.</p><h3>The Third Layer is the Collective Unconscious</h3><p>We cannot experience the collective unconscious directly like we
experience complexes as it is deeply unconscious.</p><p>This layer is common to all of humanity. Some may doubt this due to lack
of evidence. Jung provided evidence. Since his time there is little doubt
the psyche has symbol producing capacity. For example, almost all humans
are born with five fingers. Some may not due to genetic defect or
problematic pregnancy,  generally all do have five fingers. We don’t ever
question this part of being human as it is self evident. The collective
conscious is also self-evident. </p><p>Humans apart from being tool users, are also symbol makers and
story-tellers. We create symbols daily and are surrounded by a symbol
laden world. Advertising symbols, objects in our world are symbols.
Specifically, they are symbolic images or archetypal images. Structures in
the collective unconscious are archetypes. “Archetypes are the inherited
part of the psyche. Structuring patterns of psychological performance
linked to instinct. A hypothetical entity irrepresentable in itself and
evident only through its manifestations.  </p><p>An archetype is a symbol producing structure. </p><p>“Inherited part of the psyche”
It is common to all humans. It is inherited like having five fingers on your left hand. </p><p>“Structuring patterns of psychological performance linked to instinct”
Archetype creates or structures patterns or symbols ways of seeing or
experiencing this is linked to instinct. </p><p>“Hypothetical Entity”
A theoretical structure it does not exist at an anatomical level in the
psyche.  Example of an x-ray.  We go to the x-ray room, put on a gown and
the protective equipment and sit in a chair. Then we hear a click. We
don’t see anything or perceive anything except a click.  Later we see
a dark film with a ghostly outline of our body. Something did happen but
we experience it as the dark x-ray file. </p><p>Another example: a recipe.</p><p>You don’t eat a recipe but an instance of the recipe that has been
created.  This is much like the relationship between the archetype and the
archetypal image.</p><p>There are many archetypes in the collective unconscious.  We experience
them as symbols of our world. We we dream, we recall these archetypal
images or symbols. </p><h3>Final Layer: The Body</h3><p>There is no distinction between the mind and body in analytical
psychology.  The body expresses the workings of the psyche through
a process called somatization. To make physical that which is
psychological.  We all experience this when we are in distress or waking
from a nightmare. </p><p>The process can also work in reverse. Something may happen to the body
that results in the psyche having to deal with it such as slipping and
falling or a car accident. </p><p>Some patients report the pain of physical trauma is re-experienced when
recalling the trauma in an analytical session. </p><h2>Part II Jung’s Model of the Psyche</h2><h3>Key Topics</h3><ul><li>Compensation is a critical aspect of the working of the psyche
(psychodynamics).</li><li>The psychodynamic result of a one-sided ego stance.</li><li>The psyche is a self regulating system. This is called teleology.  The
central organizing archetype called the Self.  The relationship between
the ego and the Self is called the ego-Self axis.</li><li>The concept of psychic energy. </li></ul><p>Key book:
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Critical-Dictionary-Jungian-Analysis/dp/0415059100">Andrew Samuel’s Critical Dictionary of Analytics Psychology.</a> </p><p>We will try to develop the model from part one in a way that explains how it works. </p><h4>Compensation</h4><p><em>Samuels</em></p><p>“Jung asserted that he found an empirically demonstrative compensatory
function operative in psychological processes. This corresponds to the
self-regulatory functions of the organism observable in the physiological
sphere. Compensation means balancing, adjusting, supplementing. He
regarded the compensatory activity of the unconscious as balancing any
tendency toward one-sidedness on the part of consciousness.” </p><p>Compensation also ties into the one-sidedness of consciousness.  The
psyche is in a constant dynamic state, but a state where we go far beyond
simple homeostasis.  All aspects of the psyche are in a dynamic
relationship with each other. It is like the traffic pattern in a city.
We know that if something happens far down a busy highway,  close to our
destination, that it impacts our commute long before we get to that
event.  If a truck stalls on the highway, close to a major onramp, we
notice traffic jams occur when we leave each day for our commute. The
psyche as a system is constantly balancing itself adjusting to the
demands of the inner and outer worlds.  The ego tends to get one-sided
and is compensated for by the unconscious. Or, the unconscious state is
compensated for by the body.</p><p>This means the system of the psyche has a series of fundamental
compensatory mechanisms.  The first is between the ego and the
unconscious. The one-sided stance the ego takes results in a compensatory
response from the unconscious (often in dreams). We can see the results
in dreams and the somatic response of the body to psychological issues.
The beliefs and attitudes we hold in the conscious results in the body
trying to balance this out using compensation. </p><p>Another mechanism is between the body and the unconscious. When I feel
anxious and this stirs up unconscious content, the body expresses this
distress through somatic responses. They body expresses the unconscious
issues in a compensatory fashion.  </p><p>Another compensatory mechanism is between the whole psyche and the
environment. If the environment is threatening,  In a threatening
situation, say a car accident, the whole psyche responds with anxiety in
the ego (I am aware I am anxious). This triggers material in the
unconscious which reminds me of previous scary incidents I’ve been
through and results in somatic reactions.  </p><p>This process of compensation continues unabated throughout our day and
night.  </p><p>The one-sidedness tendency of consciousness results in the unconscious
compensating for this one-sidedness.  </p><p>Example: analysts often meet patients who have been successful in their
careers and have made a good deal of money, but in analysis they are
depressed, find their work meaningless, see no joy in their
relationships, and don’t see a way out of the situation. They are
described as having a mid-life crisis. These experiences often occur in
mid-life (40s and 50s). They have become too one-sided in their work,
family and lives. They have become a successful money-generating doctor,
lawyer or businessperson.  In the outside world of status and power they
appear to have it all. Yet, their inner world they find themselves in
poverty.  They experience severe depression, somatic complaints, loss of
hope, lower productivity and relationship problems - all the classic
symptoms of depression.  Why would someone so successful be struck with
such suffering? The answer lies in the one-sided position of the
conscious and the compensatory nature of the psyche. In pursuing career
success and wealth, they have ignored the inner world of the psyche.
These patients don’t recall their dreams, they seldom relax. They don’t
play. They spend no time in the symbolic worlds of art and literature and
have a dismal time with their family. They have become too one-sided.
Their ego stance is that of success at all costs. The compensatory
process is trying to use depression as a mechanism to alert the ego of
the need for change. </p><p>This can be stated as:  the psyche in its wisdom, knows that the
one-sided way of living cannot continue as a person is living a very
restricted life.  </p><p>What does it mean that the psyche is trying to adjust the ego stance? The
classic mid-life crisis person suffering depression that all layers of
the psyche are impacted. The ego’s function is impacted in that the
person has a harder time concentrating, is forgetful, is less productive
and is making mistakes.   The personal unconscious is impacted  in that
a series of complexes are constellated  that drive the person to more
work, longer hours and less time to themselves and this or her family.
Complexes such as achievement or the negative father come to bear and
make the person feel outside of his usual self. </p><p>Finally, the collective unconscious is involved by bringing powerful
symbols to consciousness that often scare the living hell out of the
person.  The body also expresses the distress in ways we cannot ignore.</p><p>The one-sided stance of the ego  thus produces a necessary but painful
response from the unconscious that seeps through to all layers of the
psyche.  This is an example of the process of compensation. </p><p>The psyche creates the depression to force an adjustment.  Compensation
goes far beyond the simple process of homeostasis.  Jung dealt with these
ideas through the process called teleology.  </p><h4>Teleology</h4><p>Teleology: a process that is directed towards ends rather than causes.
Jung diverges from the psychoanalytic tradition here. In classical
psychoanalysis experiences are reduced to earlier events. The reductive
approach of Freud points to earlier childhood issues in order to explain
present day suffering is an example of a reductive or causative
perspective.  Jung’s teleological perspective looks at the current
situation in terms of the following idea: </p><p>What is this current process trying to lead you towards?  If someone is
suffering from anxiety or depression Jung’s questions would be not only
“How did you come to be at this point in your life”? (reductive) , but
also “What is this place your in right now leading you towards?” Jung
didn’t reject the reductive approach in fact insisted it needed to be
addressed first, but then go a step further - what is the teleological
purpose of the current situation?  What are you being led towards? Where
will you end up if you work this piece out?  We can understand there is
some system within the psyche that directs what happens and in certain
situations creates psychological suffering in order to ameliorate deeper
psychic suffering. This whole process is directed toward an end position.
This is related to the central organizing archetype called the Self. </p><h4>The Self</h4><p>Archetypes are symbol producing aspects of the collective unconscious.  We
cannot see an archetype only the image it produces (an instance).  The
central archetype is the Self.  It is the organizing archetype that
regulates all the other archetypes and the rest of the psyche. The goal of
this regulatory process is for the individual to confront the content of
the unconscious and engage in the process of individuation.  All that we
are doing is regulated by the self. The aim of life or the teleological
goal of life is union with the Self.   </p><p><em>Samuels definition of the Self</em></p><p>“An archetypal image of man’s fullest potential and the unity of the
personality as a whole. The Self as a unifying principle within the human
psyche occupies the central position of authority in relation to
psychological life and therefore the destiny of the individual. At times
Jung speaks of the Self as initiatory of psychic life. At other times he
refers to its realization as the goal.” </p><p>The wisdom of the self: the Self is continually altering the
psychodynamics of the psyche to help toward the goal of realization of
the Self.  This is the inner wisdom of the psyche. </p><p>This process makes better sense when we consider  it psychodynamically.  </p><h4>The Ego/Self Axis</h4><p>1972 Book by Edinger “Ego and Archetype” deals with this topic.  We begin
life with a body and the Self. This is all we have until the ego is
developed. A small ego emerges from the Self and becomes an entity in the
psyche. During the first half of life the ego receives a lot of attention
making it very powerful.   </p><p>All parts of the psyche are in dynamic relation to each other.  The ego
in the first half of life becomes dominant and rules over all.  At
midlife the situation has gone too far and the ego becomes one-sided so
something has to give.  </p><p>The example of the successful professional who is struck by depression at
midlife is a classic example of ego-Self separation.  The ego is not
dealing with the content of the unconscious and a poverty now exists. The
poverty is a lack of connection with the inner symbolic riches of the
unconscious.  </p><p>The second half of life deals with making this reunification possible.
The ego has to become more related to the Self and the rest of the psyche
so if all goes well, the line between the ego and the Self shortens. The
ego accepts the need to relate to the rest of the psyche that it had
denied for most of the first half of life.  </p><p>The first half of life involves ego-Self separation while the second half
involves ego-Self re-unification.  The ego and the Self need each other
as they are in relationship. In some cases they become strained in their
relationship but overall due to the efforts of the Self result in
a healthier personality. Jung puts it this way: “The ego stands to the
self as to the moved to the mover.”  </p><p>Putting these ideas together compensation:  the one-sidedness of the ego,
the Self, teleology and the ego-Self axis. </p><p>As we develop our ego gains ascendency in the psyche. Consciousness
become the be all and end all in our opinion. This is the result of us
pushing ourselves harder and harder in the outside or ego based world to
achieve and accumulate more and become more powerful. All the while the
Self is trying to organize the rest of the psyche to deal with this
situation through compensation. The more we strive, the more our world is
based in the external.  The further and further we find ourselves from
the inner riches of the psyche. The ego-Self axis is stretched to the
point that the ego feels very little connectedness with the psyche. Then
the Self which has a teleological purpose strives to alter this one
sidedness and brings us into contact with some often unpleasant feelings
largely centered around the utter meaningless of our otherwise successful
lives.  This compensation may result in a affective disorder such as
depression or anxiety around midlife. We suddenly thrust into a crippling
depression and cannot understand why because all is well on the outside.
The Self then brings us into greater contact with the rest of the psyche
through powerful thoughts, unconscious symbols and somatic complaints. </p><p>If we interpret these experiences correctly, and heed the call of the
psyche, the ego-Self axis retreats and the ego comes into greater contact
with the symbolic inner world. It is almost as though the ego became too
complacent or too powerful and forgot its origins. As the ego lessens
this one-sided position, and meets the unconscious in a healthy way, the
whole psyche shifts and if all goes well, we go through the depression
and gain the meaning that it contains. </p><p>What was the depression all about? Depression and anxiety at midlife are
examples of how the psyche tries to self-regulate and the Self is at the
root of this experience. When we are depressed we have cognitive
difficulties in that we can’t concentrate or recall so that our
occupation becomes at risk. We have sleep difficulties and feel fatigued,
don’t want to engage in social activities or have fun. We just want to
isolate ourselves in a dark room, unplug the phone, switch off the TV and
stare at the wall.  All our normal distractions are dropped. We find
ourselves in this dark space alone, miserable and desperately unhappy. </p><p>So we now ask, what is the depression trying to lead us from and where
does it want us to go?  The depression becomes teleological or purposeful
in function forcing us to remove ourselves from the everyday, isolate and
to think about what ails us? As we sit in that dark room and stare at the
wall, we often think thoughts of the meaninglessness of our lives. We
hear ourselves say “What’s the point of all this?” How can I have
achieved so much yet be so unhappy? All these questions lead us to some
conclusions. I’m living a one-sided life, feel disconnected from
humanity, and more importantly from myself. I know there is something
better, a way to be that’s less painful. There is a more balanced life.
In these answers, we have the key.  The depression is forcing us to
reexamine our lives, and take steps to change. The change is to work with
the psyche and access the inner riches of the unconscious. Once people
start making these changes they find the depression starts to subside.
The depression is functional and purposive - it is leading us away from
a state of psychic poverty to a more balanced life.</p><p>The same system can be applied to a state of anxiety.  There can be
a great danger in eliminating the symptoms of depression without asking
what is at its core. You can antidepressants and feel better but this
would just be symptomatic. You may feel the inner restlessness that
started the depression in the first place.  Staying in the depression and
working through it can bring immense relief (assuming the depression is
not life-threatening). </p><h4>Psychic Energy</h4><p>Psychic Energy or the libido can be thought of the energy involved in the
psychodynamics of the psyche. We can imagine that all the processes in the
psyche need energy to move. That energy is psychic energy.   </p><p><em>Jung</em>:</p><p>“An energy value which is able to communicate itself to any field of
activity whatsoever be it power, hunger, hatred, sexuality or religion
without it every being itself a specific instinct. A kind of neutral
energy which is responsible for the formation of such symbols such as
light, fire, sun and the like.”</p><p>Jung used the words libido and psychic energy interchangeably.  This can
be confusing but for now realize we need psychic energy for the psyche to
do its work. </p><h4>Principles of psychic energy:</h4><p>Neutral, indestructible, follows a gradient, has an energetic amount or
value, has a potential, can be blocked or channeled, obeys the laws of
conservation and thermodynamics. Involves causality and finality,
originates in the unconscious,  and can progress and regress. </p><p>Neutral: it is not exclusively sexual as Freud suggested. It’s simply the
gas needed in the psyche.  </p><p>Indestructible:  it cannot be destroyed only transformed into another
state in the psyche.  Does this mean we have a finite amount of psychic
energy? No although Jung originally thought so.  </p><p>Follows a gradient: It moves from a position of higher intensity to lower
intensity.  </p><p>Has an energetic amount or value: We can theoretically imagine it has
a value to it. When an issue in the psyche has a very strong load or
value to it, the psychic energy build up results in the need to move to
a lower level.  </p><p>It has a potential, and can be blocked or channelled: If we block psychic
energy, its builds up and seeks an outlet in other areas. Simple example
is someone feeling a great deal of anxiety. A great deal of energy builds
up - the psyche wants the person to run away from the scary situation but
instead the person becomes aggressive. The blocked energy is channeled
into aggression.  </p><p>Obeys the laws of conservation and thermodynamics: Based on the laws of
thermodynamics in physics</p><p>Involves causality and finality: All psychic is directed toward
a particular endpoint (teleology) and is implicated in the causes of the
situation the psyche finds itself in. </p><p>Regression is a build up of psychic energy. </p><h3>Projection, Shadow, Anima/Animus</h3><h4>The Shadow</h4><p>The shadow represents the negative or unpleasant side of our psyche while
the anima/animus side represents the contrasexual side. </p><p>Why are these important? The shadow is often the early archetype we
encounter early on in analysis. It is the repository of all we find
unpleasant or shameful in ourselves and we try to hide from others. Until
we have come to terms with the shadow, we are at great risk of projecting
the shadow onto others or to act the shadow out and do mean and nasty
things to the people around us. This is why we have to meet the shadow
and to understand it well. </p><h4>Anima or Animus</h4><p>This is the feminine side of a man and the masculine side of a woman.
These are important as they serve as the fundamental basis for our choice
of partners in the outer world.  They also serve as links between
consciousness ( the outer world) and the inner world of the unconscious. </p><p><em>Jung</em>
“The archetypes most clearly characterized from the empirical point of
view are those that have the most frequent and most disturbing influence
upon the ego.  These are the shadow, the anima and the animus. The most
accessible of these and the easiest to experience is the shadow. For its
nature can in large measure be inferred from the content of the personal
unconscious.”  - Collected Works Part IX</p><h4>Projection</h4><p>The term projection is derived from classical psychoanalysis (Freud) and
is regarded as a primitive ego defense mechanism. </p><p>An operation whereby qualities, feelings, wishes or even objects which
the subject refuses to recognize or rejects in himself are expelled from
the self and located in the another person or thing.</p><p><em>Jung</em></p><p>“Projection means  the expulsion of subjective content into an object. It
is the opposite of introjection in that it is a process of dissimulation
in which a subject of content becomes alienated from the subject and is so
to speak embodied in the object.”</p><p>Both definitions are structured in a similar way. Projection is a process
or an operation in which subjective content such as qualities, feelings,
wishes or even objects which an individual cannot recognize in him or
herself are expelled and then located in another person or thing. </p><p>A key term: whatever is rejected or expelled is unconscious.  We don’t
know we are doing this and we seldom know what it is that is being
projected. Projection is a very natural process in the psyche.  We
project all the time especially when dealing with other people. </p><p>Do you remember meeting someone for the first time and they felt familiar
as though you knew them from before? As your conversation went on, you
started to see that they spoke or behaved just like someone you already
know say a sibling or an acquaintance.  Then you began to realize that
you expected them to hold certain attitudes or beliefs. Or you found
yourself distancing yourself from the other person because you already
know they held in terms of beliefs and you don’t like these beliefs. You
found some of their attitudes unattractive. This was projection. Very
little of the real information about this new person was actually present
in this interaction as most of it came from within you.  </p><p>An excellent summary of our definition is offered by Andrew Samuels:
“Jung’s approach to projection builds upon a psychoanalytical base.
Projection may be seen as normal or pathological and as a defense against
anxiety. Difficult emotions and unacceptable parts of the personality may
be located in a person or object external to the subject. The problematic
content is thereby controlled and the individual feels a release and
a sense of well being. In analytical psychology, stress has also been
lain upon projection as the means by which the contents of the inner
world are made available to ego consciousness.  The assumption is that an
encounter between the ego and such unconscious contents is of value. The
external world of persons and things serves the internal world by
provided the raw material to be activated by projection.  This can be
seen most clearly when one what is projected is also representative of
a part of the psyche. Anima and animus projections are carried by real
men and women. Without the carrier there would be no meeting. Similarly,
the shadow is frequently encountered in projection.  By definition the
shadow is the repository of what is unacceptable to consciousness. It is
therefore ripe for projection. For anything of value to be gained though
it is necessary for some reintegration or recollection of that which is
projected to take place. “</p><p>There a definite stages that we engage in when we project. When we become
aware of the discrepancy between the real person and the projections we
make onto that real person, we are starting to withdraw our projections.
This means that we are seeing the person for whom he or she really is and
not using them as a movie theater screen to project our movies onto. </p><p>This is a way to understand projection. That of a movie screen.  It is
almost as if when we meet someone and start to project we are treating
them like a movie screen a blank canvas that we then fill with images
from a movie that the unconscious generates about this person. Although
none of the projections are based on hard core facts, the are psychically
real. </p><h4>The Shadow</h4><p>The very name gives us a key to what we are dealing with: something in
the shadows, something not quite in the light; something dark. </p><p><em>Jung</em></p><p>“A closer examination of the dark characteristics, that is the
inferiorities constituting the shadow, reveals that they have an emotional
nature, a kind of autonomy and accordingly and a obsessive or better
possessive quality.”  Collected Works IX II </p><p> The shadow is highly emotionally loaded with a life of its own at times.
We know this because of what happens when we begin to project the shadow.
It feels as though it takes us over for a little while. </p><p> Try this exercise: Think of someone the same gender as you are. Someone
who you really dislike. Someone who’s habits and behaviors are quite
disgusting to you.  Someone who really irritates you with their behavior.
List the qualities that they have that you dislike:</p><ul><li>Selfish</li><li>Lacks compassion</li><li>Judgmental</li><li>Mean </li><li>Rejects -Hate for the other</li><li>Lacks a moral compass</li><li>Vindictive</li></ul><p>This person is a real, living walking example of your shadow.  The
qualities that you dislike about them so much are your own qualities: the
qualities of your shadow.  You have met your shadow and it is you.
Feeling a little uncomfortable right now? You and I both know that you
keep these qualities to yourself, very well hidden because if people knew
about your shadow side, they would never want to be around you. </p><p><em>Jung</em></p><p>“Though the shadow is a motif that is well known to mythology, as anima
and animus, it represents first and foremost the personal unconscious and
its contents can therefore be made conscious without too much difficulty.
In this it differs from anima and animus for as the shadow can be seen
and recognized fairly easily, the anima and the animus are much farther
away from consciousness. In normal circumstances are seldom if ever
realized. With a little self-criticism, one can see through the shadow so
far as its nature is personal. But, when it appears as an archetype, one
encounters the same difficulties as with the anima and animus. In other
words, it is quite within the bounds of possibility for a man to
recognize that relatively evil side of his nature but it is a rare and
shattering experience to gaze into the face of absolute evil.“</p><ul><li>Collective Works XI II </li></ul><p>We can think of the shadow as a complex. Recall that complexes are the
structures we find within the personal unconscious.  We can imagine the
complex to have three layers almost like an onion.</p><p>The outer layer is the personal shadow.  The middle layer is the cultural
shadow, the core or inner part is the archetype of the shadow.  Remember
complexes belong to the personal unconscious and archetypes belong to the
collective unconscious.  So this core of the complex contains an
archetype that is connected to the archetype in the collective
unconscious.  </p><p>The first layer of the shadow is built up with all of experiences with
the darker part of life. As an infant we get early messages from our
parents certain behaviors are bad or naughty. We try to stop these
behaviors but they all wind up adding to this first layer of the shadow
complex in the form of the personal shadow. So this layer is composed of
all the nasty or shameful parts of yourself that you prefer no one else
knows about. Your spitefulness, your bigotry, your racism, your cruelty,
etc… </p><p><em>Jung</em></p><p>The shadow “ is the thing the person has no wish to be.”</p><ul><li>Collected Works XVI </li></ul><p>The next layer is the cultural shadow. Think of how the society you grew
up in has a dark side. A side in which people are discriminated against,
persecuted. Your cultural shadow is the manner in which Native Americans
have been stripped of their lands, their language, and their culture.
Another cultural shadow in the wholesale degradation of the natural world
(clear cutting of the forests for example).  All societies have a dark
side. </p><p>The inner layer is the shadow archetype. We know this archetype well as
we have seen the archetypal image that derives from it in a variety of
places. For example, people raised in the Christian religion know that
the devil is the embodiment of the archetypal shadow. We often tend to
think of historical figures as being the embodiment of the archetypal
shadow: people such as Hitler or Stalin. If we consider what these
individuals did in their time, we can understand they enacted something
beyond simple bigotry; something far more powerful than simple
discrimination. They enacted archetypal forces of the shadow. The
holocaust is a horrific example of just how terrifying the archetypal
shadow can be.  What is very important in our understanding of the shadow
is how well we actually know it.    Jung was clear that we could never
eliminate the shadow but only come to terms with it. There is a very good
reason why we cannot eliminate the shadow. At the core of the shadow
complex is an archetype. The archetype of the shadow and we are not able
to alter our archetypes, only to become more conscious of their impact on
the rest of the psyche. This means that we know what our shadow qualities
are, cringe whenever we think about these qualities but endeavor not to
enact them on others.  As Luke Skywalker finds in Star Wars, the evil we
see around us is within us too. This means that if we are conscious of
our shadow, we are also far less prone to project the shadow onto others,
and even better,  we have an less tendency to enact the shadow.  </p><h4>The Anima and the Animus</h4><p><em>Samuels</em></p><p>“The inner figure of woman held by a man and the figure of man at work in
a woman’s psyche” </p><p>The anima exists in a man and the animus in a woman.  Don’t make the
common mistake we all do when we begin Jungian Psychology in thinking
they both exist in a man or a woman. They are archetypal images and they
are not available immediately to consciousness.  Both are of vital
importance to the psyche’s functioning but because they are unconscious,
they can also be projected.  </p><p><em>Samuels</em></p><p> “They act as a psychopomp or guides of soul and they can become necessary
links with creative possibilities and instruments of individuation.
Because of their archetypal connections anima and animus have been
represented in many collective forms and figures. As Aphrodite, Athena,
Helen of Troy, Mary, Sapientia, and Beatrice, or as Hermes, Apollo,
Hercules, Alexander the Great or Romeo. In projection they are attract
attention and emotional fervor as public figures but also as friends,
lovers, commonplace and ordinary wives and husbands. We meet them as
consorts in our dreams. As personified components of psyche they connect
and involve us with life. ” </p><p> The idea of personification is really important to our model. We tend to
project a sense of otherness in other words as a man I project the
personification of the anima onto women. Because this personification is
quite other to me, it is not me in its form. So as a man the otherness is
projected as female. For a woman this otherness is projected as male. In
so doing, the anima and animus act as mediators between the ego and
consciousness and the unconscious. These two archetypes are contentious
issues in our day. When Jung published his ideas, being a man of his time
he wrote about these two archetypes in a very stereotyped fashion. And it
is this manner of writing that has led to the controversy. Whether you
agree with the constructs or not, start with beginning to understand them
in terms of the psychodynamics of the psyche. Once you consider yourself
fluent in their use, then go a little further and try to find alternative
ways to represent otherness in the psyche.  If you are interested in this
material, great book “Jung, a feminist revision”. </p><p> One of the core issues in the anima and the animus is that one can be
gripped by these powerful images and this may cause an alteration in your
behavior.  </p><p><em>Samuels</em></p><p>“Possession by either anima or animus transforms a personality in such
a way as to give prominence to those traits which are seen as being
psychologically characteristic of the opposite sex.   Either way a person
loses individuality first of all and then in either case both charm and
values. In a man he becomes dominated by anima and eros principles with
connotations of restlessness, promiscuity, moodiness, sentimentality,
whatever could be described as unconstrained emotionality. A woman subject
to the authority of the animus and logos is managerial, obstinate,
ruthless and domineering. Both become one-sided. He is seduced by inferior
people and forms meaningless attachments. She being taken in by second
rate thinking, marches forward under the banner of unrelated convictions.“</p><p>You can see just from this very loaded language that these constructs are
hot topics in analytical psychology.  We also note from the above quote
what would happen to us if we are dominated by the anima or the animus. </p><p>Let’s try a quick experiment:</p><p>Think of your ideal partner. So for a straight male imagine the ideal
woman. What would she look like?  How tall is she? What does her body, her
hair and her skin look like? How does she behave? What does she do for
a living? How is she in bed? How does she comfort you when you are having
a bad day? Is she strong and dominant or more submissive? Does she write
poetry or paint? Is she good enough to be the mother of your children? Now
that you have this ideal woman in your mind, realize that you have just
personified aspects of your anima. </p><p>For a straight woman imagine the ideal man.  Do the same thing. What does
he look like? How tall is he? What does his body, skin and hair look
like? Is he strong or is he weak? Does he protect you or lead the way?
Does he initiate activities? Is he nurturing and communicative or silent
and deep?  How is he in bed? What does he do when you feel upset or
scared after a hard day at work?  This ideal male is a personification of
the animus.   </p><p>Jung: Collective Work XI under definitions. </p><h3>The Persona</h3><p><em>Samuels</em></p><p>The term derived from the latin word for the mask actors wore in
classical times. Hence, persona refers to the mask or face a person puts
on to confront the world. Persona can refer to gender identity, or
a stage of development such as adolescence, a social status, a job or
profession. Over a lifetime many personas will be worn and several may be
combined at any one moment.</p><p>What does this mean for you and I? We all have at least one persona. More
likely, we have far more than that. Often our person is based on
something we do or are expected to do in society such as being an
employee, or lawyer or a supporter of a football team. When we are in
this role, we tend to act in ways that are consistent with how others are
expected to view us. As the lawyer, we may always  try to be arrodite or
wise.  As a football team supporter, we wear particular team colors,
assemble with other supporters and are often loud in public. All the time
we are acting out a persona. I find it useful to pay attention to not
only what we are doing in terms of our behaviour, but also what clothes
we wear, how we speak and especially what we actually say and think. Very
important here is to note that we have to have a persona. Without it, we
are naked in the world and have nothing between us and (the ego)  and the
external world (the unconscious). We have nothing to hide behind, no
clear sense of how to act, or what to wear or what to say. So you can see
you have to have a persona. </p><p>Those poor souls who have weak personas suffer tremendously in the world
because they don’t know who to be in any particular moment and feel that
people can see right through them and that they have no defenses. I often
think of persona as a form of defense against the world. Remember when we
were small, how we didn’t really care what the grown ups thought of us.
We just wanted to play and to have some fun. We had very basic personas
and these personas were not consciously chosen. They just developed out
of the psyche. We were known as a serious little child or a very
boisterous little girl.  But at the end of the day, we really didn’t care
so long as we could have fun and to play. What makes small children so
endearing to us is not only their ability to move between reality and
play (or the conscious and the unconscious worlds)  but also how they
don’t have strong personas so we are able to see the real child at all
times. </p><p>This is so different when we are adults as we learn to persona up and not
let our guard down. As we grew older and went to school at around five or
six, we suddenly realized that certain kids like certain behaviours and
we started to act out these behaviors. Here is where we consciously began
to adjust our personas and started to realize that we can have more than
one. We can have a persona for inside the classroom, one for recess, and
one for home. As we progress through school we really started to work on
our personas. Because we know that this is the way to ensure our
friendships and connections with other kids at school.  Then puberty sets
in and the young adolescent finds themselves in quite a pickle because
now we aren’t really sure which personas really work.  We then go to
extremes often first with the external quality persona of our clothing.
All of these are attempts to find an identity. The persona is crucial in
this process. </p><p>One of the functions of the ego is to provide stability of identity and
personality over time. The persona is involved in this process. Remember
those times when having the right clothes was really really important?
How you had to get the right bicycle or the right toy? Nowadays this must
be really difficult for adolescents as they not only have adjust their
internal way of being, but have to be aware of rapidly changing trends in
clothing. Which brand is in and which one is out. Or which video game
console is more trendy and which one isn’t. Even worse, which cell phone
or web service we should use. All of this contributes to the rapid
development and alteration of the persona. When you next see adolescents
on the street or in your home, and you shake your head or their strange
clothing or body piercing or language remember that all they are trying
to do is to test out which persona works for them.  Those of you that
have been through this with your own children know that very shortly the
extreme behaviors and clothing will end and your kids develop a fairly
consistent persona which involves not only what to wear but also what
subjects to take at school, what music to listen to, and which friends to
keep.</p><p>As we finish our schooling or university life, and head out into careers,
we know that each particular career has a specific persona. We soon
realize from watching role models in our chosen profession, how we are
supposed to behave. What to drink, what to eat and what to wear.  But
most importantly, what way to act in the company of others.  This can be
quite daunting at first. How is a lawyer, doctor, or a dentist supposed
to act? Not only in their consulting room but out in the company of
others. We tend to develop particular personas through identifying with
roles models already in these professions. </p><p>I’m sure you know people who stay in their professional persona all the
time. If you have a doctor friend and that person is always acting the
doctor, dispensing advice at dinner parties or other social gatherings,
you can see that he or she is stuck in their persona. After a while it
becomes really irritating and you want to shake them up and say “Just be
real!” </p><p>There is a strong risk that we over identify with our persona. This leads
to one-sidedness (something we touched on earlier) and a great deal of
trouble in later life. But equally problematic is someone who changes
their persona too often. If we see them at work they are so different
from at a party or at the theatre or at the a game. We get confused with
whom we are dealing. And we want to go up to these folks and give them
a shake too and say “Just be consistent!” </p><p>Jung saw the persona as an archetype. In all humans there is a need to
engage with other people in a variety of settings. So a klan chief had to
act in a certain way. The young males and females were expected to act in
equally defined ways. We know that even in our massive societal
structures, we need people to behave in certain ways. Meaning we need
them to stay in a certain persona that is consistent with their function,
office or occupation. We get shocked when we hear of people acting
outside of their role. So if we hear of a police arrested for drunk
driving, it bothers us far more than some nameless person arrested for
the same thing. We expect our judges to be wise and never to display
instinctual or irrational behavior. So if a judge makes a statement from
the bench that is inconsistent with that role, we find it troubling and
often want that judge to resign his or her position. The same can be said
for teach, a doctor , a priest, or any other such occupation for that
matter. Isn’t is interesting that we all seem to have a fairly consistent
cultural expectation of occupational personas. These personas often vary
across cultures but within cultures we all have a solid sense of what is
expected of how particular personas should be displayed in public.  </p><p>If we look at how comics often lampoon politicians in public it is so
interesting to see how they often choose behaviors or actions that vastly
opposite from their public personas. It is when we over identify with
a persona where we land in trouble because what happens when the ego over
identifies with a rigid persona, is that the unconscious tends to burst
into consciousness in severe and unpredictable ways.  </p><p>For example, if we think back to the people in a clinical setting
I described in episode three, which I called the model of the psyche, we
had an over identification with the persona and severe depression
resulted. This is an example of the compensatory nature of the psyche.
When things are too heavily weighted in one area of the psyche, say the
persona, the unconscious tends to load up with psychic energy and at some
point a massive unloading results in unconscious material erupting into
consciousness. Often this eruption is in a severe affective disorder such
as depression or anxiety or may even result in somatization. </p><p>You can see why this aspect of the model outlined earlier is so important
to our psychodynamic understanding of the psyche.  The same lack of
balance exists in individual who has a very weak persona. You may
encounter these individuals and they seem to need to exist in their own
fantasy world, their own inner world which on the face of it is a good
thing as we all need to encounter and confront the unconscious, but if we
retreat into the unconscious too far, we really struggle to keep one foot
in the external ego based world and the other in the internal unconscious
world. </p><p>Overall we need the persona to be a compliment for the workings of  the
psyche. The ego is vital in this relationship because if it is rigidly
identified with the persona, it is an ego that looks outwards only;
outwards into the external world and is quite blind to the inner world of
the unconscious.  Patients in this stage may say oh I haven’t had a dream
for years. We know this cannot be the case as we all dream every night.
It’s just that we don’t recall our dreams. These patients as they begin
their work in analysis and start to recognize their unconscious often
find themselves having intense dreams each night that they are able to
recall. It is almost as if the ego which we need to help us to recall
dreams each night suddenly looks over its back and says oh yeah
I remember that stuff. All that stuff about the unconscious and dreams
and symbols - I haven’t seen that side of myself since I was very small.
This is a way for us to see that when we pay attention to the inner
world, and begin to lessen our excessive attention to the outer world,
a balancing or compensatory action in the psyche is stimulated. So the
persona is a mediator between the external world of others and the ego.
It can be thought of as a defense for the ego.  The anima and animus are
mediators between the internal world and the ego.  The persona and the
anima or animus can be thought of as opposites. They fulfill very
opposite roles. For the persona dealing with external world and the ego,
and the anima/animus dealing with the ego and the internal world. Both
are critical in the process of adaptation. </p><h3>Enantiodromia</h3><p>Greek word meaning running contrary-wise or things turn into their
opposite.  This refers in part to an aspect of compensation. </p><p>Example (joke): regular old boring accountant who slogs away at his
business for years, neglects his wife and kids and lives a very sterile
life. Then in mid-life suddenly looks up from his desk at his young
assistant, tells her to grab her passport , buys a red sports car and
drives away with her to Mexico where he acts out his new lust for life.
Then, six weeks later he come back to his wife and family terribly
ashamed because he finally realizes what he has done and what he has
neglected all his adult life: the world of the symbolic, the relatedness
between his conscious and unconscious and between himself and other
people in the world .</p><p>This is enantiodromia. From this serious, sterile persona identified
accountant to the wreckless playboy.  He has turned into his opposite.
Jung felt this word represents a principle in the psyche in which
eventually, everything turns into its opposite. Because we know something
about psychic energy from earlier we can speak of enantiodromia in a more
psychodynamic way. If an extreme one-sided way exists in consciousness,
psychic energy has to balance this one-sided position. This means that
psychic energy loads up in the unconscious to balance out the ego stance.
Finally, this intense psychic energy in the unconscious  breaks through
and erupts into consciousness with all the concomitant problems. </p><p>This eruption takes the form of dreams, intense affects or more seriously
strong somatic reactions. We will soon turn to interpretation of dreams.
We now have and strong enough understanding of psychodynamic processes
and structures to begin to make sense of dreams from a Jungian
perspective. </p><p>There is another process that we need to review before we launch into
dreams: the difference between a symbol and a sign and how to expand or
amplify a symbol. </p><h3>Signs</h3><p>What exactly is a sign and how does it differ from a symbol? A sign is
something with a fixed meaning. This meaning is culturally or universally
understood even though there might be slight variations across cultures.
An example of a sign is the octagonal red sign we use for a traffic stop
sign. It has only one meaning - that of bring your vehicle to a complete
halt just before this red sign. It doesn’t mean drive through, yield or
buy a hamburger or fries.  In pretty much all cultures the same sign, the
stop sign, is used to mean the same thing.</p><p>Another sign would be the red exit sign that we see above the exit door
in a movie theatre or in an office.  It only means leave this place
through the door. It is often red in color so that we can all see it in
an emergency. Most if not all of us know that in an emergency you need to
exit at this place. </p><p>So a sign is a word, a shape or an object that has a single, fixed
meaning.  Here is where we run into some difficulties when we speak of
symbols and signs. In classical Freudian psychoanalysis will know that
many of the objects that Freud interpreted in dreams say hills or tunnels
or apples of bananas were referred to in a way that made them signs.  The
apple equals the female breast in Freudian dream interpretation or the
banana means the male penis. One sign has one meaning. So it is quite
incorrect from a Jungian perspective to interpret dream imagery in fixed
ways. From this perspective, stay away from those dreadful dream
dictionaries you find at bookstores that tell you if you dreamt of an
apple it means a breast or any other such fixed meaning. These dreams
should be called dream sign dictionaries and not dream symbol
dictionaries. </p><h3>Symbols</h3><p>How do signs differ from symbols?  A crucial difference is that a symbol
does not have a fixed, singular meaning. Jung, in dealing with the
difference between Freudian sign interpretation and his own symbol
interpretation said the following:</p><p>“The true symbol differs essentially from this and should be understood
as an intuitive idea that cannot yet be formulated in any other or better
way.“</p><p>“A symbol always presupposes that the chosen expression is the best
possible description or formulation of a relatively unknown fact. Which
is nonetheless known to exist or is postulated as existing.”  Collective
Works XI</p><p>This leaves us in some difficulty. How then do we know what a symbol
means?  What if I get it wrong and say it means something completely
different from someone else? In this situation you are quite safe because
you know what a symbol means to you better than anyone else. Because you
get a meaning about a symbol from your own unconscious; your own
feelings, and your own experiences.  Example:  say you dreamt of a horse.
You told your dream to a friend and began to explain the meaning of
a horse. In other words you begin to enlarge on the meaning of the
symbol. As a child you may have been thrown from a horse and broken your
arm, and never ridden one since. You may dislike and fear horses as
a result and find the appearance of a horse symbol in your dream to be
scary and threatening.  The meaning of the horse symbol to you is very
negative. Your friend on the other hand, may have been raised on a cattle
ranch and spent many hours of his childhood on the back of a horse
rounding up cattle. He may have had a favorite horse that he trained and
rode for the years that he spent at home on the ranch. To him, the horse
is a solid, powerful, dependable creature that help do his ranch chores,
was his good friend and helped him get through some difficult terrain or
times. The horse symbol for him is one of a positive, loyal, dependable
friend. This is quite different to your meaning of the horse. Which one
is wrong  on the meaning of the horse symbol? This answer is neither. You
are both absolutely correct as you are developing a meaning of the horse
symbol from your actual lived experience.  </p><p>The meaning of a symbol becomes accurate largely from your own
experience. Symbol dictionaries are best used to see the more universal
aspects of a symbols meaning.  You are the best symbol dictionary in the
world. As you rely on your own psyche to provide the meaning. This isn’t
where it all ends. All we have really done is develop are personal
associations to the symbol.  From this association we do need to enlarge
this symbol by tapping into its more universal nature. As images are such
powerful images and exist in the collective unconscious, we need to see
how different cultures attribute meaning to a different symbol. This
means that the core meaning of a symbols is the same across cultures, but
each culture will add something specific to its own cultural meaning of
a symbol.  Here the symbol dictionary is useful. </p><h3>Amplification</h3><p><em>Samuels</em></p><p>Amplification involves use of mythic, historical and cultural parallels in
order to clarify and make ample the metaphorical content of dream
symbolism. </p><p><em>Jung</em></p><p>The psychological tissue in which the image is embedded. Amplification
enables the dreamer to abandon a purely personal and individualistic
attitude toward the dream image. It emphasizes a metaphorical hence
approximate rather than a literal translation of dream content and
prepares the dreamer to exercise choice. This is done by acknowledging
what is most immediately relevant for the dreamer and then allowing for
further understanding as a consequence of reflection. </p><p> An additional possibility, though one not specifically formulated by
Jung,  is that by way of amplification one consciously experiences
oneself within and as part of archetypal energies rather than as their
object. </p><p> This refers to enlarging our personal meaning of a dream using the
process of amplification. So what we are actually doing in the process of
amplification is focusing our attention on the archetypal image that the
symbol is and going beyond our own associations to the same image. There
is something greater to the symbol of the horse than simply saying it is
the thing that threw me and caused me to break my arm.  The first part of
our work in interpreting a symbol was to develop personal associations to
that symbol. The next phase is to develop universal meaning of the
symbol, but there is a serious danger in symbol amplification of becoming
overly intellectual. The key here is to do the research required for the
amplification but to stay with the material that grips your attention. As
soon as you find yourself reading about some arcane symbol meaning, in
some specific culture you don’t feel anything anymore for the symbol, you
know you’ve gone too far. This is especially so in amplifying your dream
symbols.  The symbols that you have in your dream are yours and are their
for a very specific reason. So amplify only until you feel the symbol
begins to lose its value or energy.  Don’t thrash a symbol to death in
amplifying it,  just add something that really peaks your interest or has
specific relevance to your dream or to your life. This is a very
difficult thing to do as we are all used to overworking the meaning of
symbols when we begin this process.  </p></div></div></div></section><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/johnbetts","query":{},"buildId":"W3k_rXZjZqNPegYJ8EO1N","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false}</script><script nomodule="" src="/_next/static/chunks/polyfills-070779da9cfe0fee3499.js"></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/main-72ab2d50c8f38f056049.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/webpack-488dc228921f1fdbc0e7.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/framework.de5b927bb3a122da5a2a.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/fc4c39875ead1a4c499caee77412af46292a2d12.ed4d58faabcf26e54f52.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/pages/_app-86be649a130bd690c748.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/21b7afd40ce8df2634a1e588f07acafe62ac56a5.c962c418307358521c69.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/pages/johnbetts-045dc03ae093d44cf47d.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/W3k_rXZjZqNPegYJ8EO1N/_buildManifest.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/W3k_rXZjZqNPegYJ8EO1N/_ssgManifest.js" async=""></script></body></html>
