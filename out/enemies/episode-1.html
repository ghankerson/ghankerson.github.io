a fundamental way an enemy defines the boundary of our own identity. In order
for me to collect a sense of identity, I have to have something that is
different from myself. The idea of enemy begins with otherness. It begins with
the feeling of here is where I stop and you begin.</p><p>At root it is not a malevolent impulse. It is more of a discrimination impulse.</p><h3>Formation</h3><p>The way this apparatus forms in human beings we have a long dependent
childhood where we group up in a relational setting of a family. A family
also has its stories and identifications: &quot;we are this kind of people and
those other people are another kind of people.&quot; By the time we reach
maturity, around 25 years, we have already have an elaborate sense of who
I am, what I like, what my values are, and what my ideals are. All this
requires somebody else who sees things differently. </p><p>On one hand this process of sorting out self and other is a natural process,
not inherently malevolent, not something that is designed to be a weapon, but
it is easily associated with the feeling that we need to protect ourselves,
particularly in a moment of emotional threat. As adults we are very sensitive
to emotional threat. We are sensitive to feelings that we are less than, that
we are other, that we are unknown. When we are with someone who feels that way
we can immediately identify them as the enemy: your are the one who causes
pain, your are the one who has failed, you are the one who is aggressive. You
are the perpetrator.</p><p>There is an arc from the normal development of all of us in terms of selfing
and othering. The differentiation of self and other eventually gets associated
with are tendency to feel that the bad guy is the other. So when there is
a feeling of threat or anxiety we have a very difficult time stepping back from
blaming the other. </p><h3>Question</h3><p>When we are in the middle of these emotions where we feel threat or
anxiety, how do we learn to step back? Are there skills we can learn to
learn this awareness?</p><p>The first and fundamental step is we have to become aware that we&#x27;re doing
something in order to not do it any longer. </p><p>We are talking about subjective or inter-subjective involvement with
otherness. Here we are creating an enemy. It&#x27;s a very different situation
if violence is done against you unprovoked. For example, if you&#x27;re raped,
attacked without provocation, or even with provocation or in a situation
where violence is done against you, that is a different situation that we
will discuss later.</p><h3>Reactivity</h3><p>When you become an adult, you have a lot of reactivity to things you don&#x27;t
like, don&#x27;t believe in or disagree with. These for a sense of otherness.
A sense of this is not me. This is not the kind of person I am. So as you
are walking around as an adult, you perceive yourself doing nothing except
responding to the realities around you. You may feel that other people are
provoking you, especially a partner or say an adult child. So the very
first step is to become aware of how you create a situation by saying
certain things, reacting in certain ways. </p><h3>Attribution to the Other</h3><p>For example, as soon as you attribute a characteristic to your listener,
your companion, your interlocutor, the other person may react by becoming
defensive. If you imply that the other person a quality they perceive as
negative such as they are stupid or forgetful for example, the other
person unconsciously picks up the threat and becomes defensive. This might
be active aggression such as criticizing you, or passive aggression like
stonewalling or procrastinating, or even just kind of freezing up. As soon
as the other person feels a threat by your attribution, even if its not
conscious, then evokes the defensiveness in the other person who responds
and soon a vicious circle has begun to take hold. This can be between two
people, two groups or two nations. In that attribution are these negative
attributions of otherness. The attribution is that you are (the other is)
the bad guy, you have nefarious motives.</p><p>If we find ourselves in such a situation and are able to work within
ourselves to recognize what is going on we could probably diffuse the
situation or at least attempt to do so.</p><p>Hopefully this is ultimately this is a simpler, more natural way to
understand how these terrible, repetitive, and destructive conflicts take
place because:</p><ol><li>We have a very strong belief that is a natural part of being an adult
that the world happens to us. We think we aren&#x27;t doing something to
create these situations, and that we are to some extent are the victim
of these circumstances. </li><li>We have to recognize that in this moment I am co-creating the conflict.
I am saying or doing something that helps to generate conflict.</li><li>I am perceiving you as really different from me and thus cutting myself
off from you - lessening the chance of resolution.</li></ol><p>The first step is realizing this - that you are doing something to create
this conflict and you are not just the victim. This is the hardest step
and takes people the longest time. This is the first building block.</p><p>Humanity has not woken up to this. People do not see the degree to which
they create an enemy because they need that enemy - they need somebody or
something to blame for things that have gone wrong and for the violence
that is naturally in all of us. We want to believe that its someplace else
not in us.</p><h3>Equality</h3><p>For this reason its very difficult for humans to be in equal
relationships. Today partner in marriage and often in business want to
have reciprocal relationships. In order to truly do that, you have to be
able to solve conflicts together and understand that we have co-created
the conflict. Far too often today, people just quit in this process and
leave. We feel like we are the victim and that it is happening to us. We
don&#x27;t see that we participated in the conflict. Changing this is very,
very difficult. Doing this is an evolutionary jump - the evolution of
consciousness. If we can do this we can find freedom and peace. </p><h3>Human Consciousness</h3><p>The advantage (and disadvantage) that humans have over other animals on
earth is we can think about our own thoughts and feelings. We can take
a step back - it&#x27;s called de-centering. We can reflect on the action we
have taken after we have taken it and say oh, what did I create there?
Reality didn&#x27;t just happen to us. No other animal can do that. It can also
be detrimental to us in that the capacity to de-center in that we can
communicate what we don&#x27;t see in the moment - we can gossip. Harari in
<em>Sapiens</em> <a>talks a lot about this</a>. The
development of consciousness is the development of our ability to examine our
thoughts, feelings and motives to allow us to see that we have a power in
creating a sense of reality - reality doesn&#x27;t just happen to us.</p><h3>The Perspective from Buddhism and Psychoanalysis</h3><p>Buddhism is a frame of reference on the world. From moment to moment we have
a modicum of freedom to what we are doing. This is so important because we also
do create the other. We have a reaction, we begin to perceive the other party
in a certain negative way, we say things, we evoke things. The other party
begins to have a reaction and all of a sudden we are in cyclical conflict. We
are rising together. From a Buddhist perspective we have a responsibility to
know this.</p><p>From a psychoanalytic perspective we find some tools to examine this . We can
begin to recognize on a moment to moment basis that we have some repetitive or
fixed unconscious thoughts and behaviors called complexes in Jungian
psychology. Freudians call it a repetition compulsion. Other schools of
psychoanalytic thought call it projection or projective identification. The
technical vocabulary isn&#x27;t as important as understanding it from our own
experience.</p><p>As a therapist Polly Young-Eisendrath can see how couples in particular create
each other and get locked in a food fight. Then the food fight starts to
diminish their capacity to solve a conflict. This diminishes their intimacy
and their enjoyment of and trust in each other.</p><h3>What is trust?</h3><p>A sense of trust is the feeling we belong and feeling at ease. If your
sense of trust is dependent on certain beliefs and ideals
being met, if you need these conditions to trust, you never have any
freedom from your feeling of being threatened when it happens. You won&#x27;t
be awake to your own tendencies and being able to work with your own
thoughts and feelings. If you trust you can be conscious of your thoughts,
feeling and tendencies anywhere with anyone, under almost any circumstances,
you can be free. The groundworkd for belonging shifts to a process that you can
use everywhere. </p><p><em>Eleanor Johnson</em>: if we could truly do this we would be saints.</p><p><em>Polly Young-Eisendrath</em>: it&#x27;s the possibility of becoming human. Humans can so
something that other animals can&#x27;t to do. We can de-center. We can examine our
own motivation, our own blind spots and negative emotions, and our own moment
to moment experiences and hold open the possibility that we can go somewhere we
have never been before. </p><p><em>Polly Young-Eisendrath</em>: as a therapist she seldoms sees a couple come to
her and say &quot;I realize I don&#x27;t see my partner fairly.&quot;  They want to
change the whole relational pattern but they want her (the therapist) to
change it. All she can do is wake up each person to learn they are
co-creating the conflict.</p><p>There is a process that begins with becoming aware that you are actually
creating an other moment to moment to moment. Many times its to defend
yourself. Then the next step is can you step back (de-center) and listen
to what the other person is saying.</p><h3>War and Peace</h3><p>What is the true meaning of peace? To answer this you have to be willing
to step into war. What&#x27;s my relationship to the outer enemy? How do I find
the inner nazi in me? How do I deal with hatred? War and peace are always
together - they arise together. They come from some kind of motivation
within the homo sapien for one thing or the other. As long as humans have
been on earth we have not lived peacefully. We are inherently violent.
There is no other species that is motivated by ideals and opinions to harm
another member of its species. 	It isn&#x27;t just that I will come at you with
a hatchet because you came at me with a hatchet. I can come at you with
a hatchet because of what you believe. We all have a responsibility to
ensure we have the opportunity for they dynamic of war to open up and be
war and peace so we can have conflict and resolution on a moment to moment
basis instead of long, protracted periods of war. </p><p>Learing this personally allows us to disarm the atomic bomb in our hearts.
Sometimes we have ideals that go beyond humanity. If you follow ideals you
lose humanity. If you follow humanity you have to lose ideals. Homo
sapiens are violent by nature but can we use this unique human
intelligence to have the freedom to say - do I want to say these words to
this person? If I do what are the consequences? Or is it possible not to
say the words. That kind of intelligence that examines itself and stops
mid-action is unique to humans. We also have all the animal impulses. This
higher intelligence is availble to all of us but we don&#x27;t access it often
because we generally feel like victims. </p><p>Practicing this in our families is a wonderful place to hone this skill.
The more you practice this, the more you understand war and peace. Ifyou
practice this on the level of let me see if I understand even if
I disagree with what you say - let me work with my own feelings so I don&#x27;t
have to make them your responsibilites. The more we do this ; the more we
understand what is involved on a larger social and cultural level with
regards to war and peace.</p><p>If you can begin to see this maybe our species has something that goes
beyond animal reactivity and we become protectors of human consciousness
because human consciousness has this freedom that we can take advantage
of.</p></div></div></div></section><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/enemies/episode-1","query":{},"buildId":"J7-B4Mr47aPG_TQWb9opr","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false}</script><script nomodule="" src="/_next/static/runtime/polyfills-76241b0d74e4e8c37642.js"></script><script async="" data-next-page="/_app" src="/_next/static/J7-B4Mr47aPG_TQWb9opr/pages/_app.js"></script><script async="" data-next-page="/enemies/episode-1" src="/_next/static/J7-B4Mr47aPG_TQWb9opr/pages/enemies/episode-1.js"></script><script src="/_next/static/runtime/webpack-c212667a5f965e81e004.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/framework.c6faae2799416a6da8e8.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/844685bc4b5ed7474705654e0a89d310edc896bd.6d034c46da28dcca91f3.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/runtime/main-1c7e1d107dc57d1a56ad.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/J7-B4Mr47aPG_TQWb9opr/_buildManifest.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/J7-B4Mr47aPG_TQWb9opr/_ssgManifest.js" async=""></script></body></html>
