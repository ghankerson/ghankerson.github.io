connection, it takes up a new attitude in the world. The variation of
the myth, gods, symbols and archetypes are the expression but also the
instrument of this change.  This means being detached from uroboros and
born into the lower world of reality full of danger, discomfort, and the
ego is aware of pain and pleasure. The world becomes ambivalent. </p></li><li><p>Nature (the uroboros) is unconscious and combines meaningful creation
with meaningless destruction.</p></li><li><p>The wicked, devouring mother and the good mother are the two sides of
the uroboric Mother Goddess who reign over this psychic stage.</p></li><li><p>The growing ambivalence give rise to an equally ambivalent attitude
toward the archetype in whose power it lies.</p></li><li><p>The overwhelming might of the unconscious is seen as the evil mother
the goddess of death, famine, plague flood and the sweetness that leads
to destruction.  In contrast the good mother is the dispenser of life
and the womb of cornucopia who provides an image of resurrection, rebirth
and new life.</p></li><li><p>Against all this the ego/individual remains small and weak.
Consciousness has not yet established a firm foothold in the ocean of
the unconscious. The ego is defenseless against this maelstrom of
a mysterious being who bombards the ego from within and without.</p></li><li><p>Early man&#x27;s life has a feeling of constant endangerment as danger and
uncertainty are everywhere. <em>The external world of famine and flood is
projected as demons. The inner world is inhabited by these demons as
witches, monsters, and magicians whose invisible workings manifest as
emotional outburst, lust, murderous impulses, visions and
hallucinations.</em> Fear rules - we haven&#x27;t rid ourselves of this today.</p></li><li><p>The same horrors are known to the child who is largely unconscious and
confronts every event as a devastating innovation exposed to every whim
of the world and man.  The combination of the dread of the horrors of
the outside world combined with inside world made mysterious by
projection. This creates an animalistic and dynamistic world view.</p></li><li><p>This dread is an expression of the small, feeble ego pit against the
cosmos.</p></li><li><p>For this reason fear is a normal phenomenon for a child. It is
eventually outgrown but also provides an incentive for for growth. The
ability to articulate fear helps overcome it so it is wrong to seek to
get rid of fear in this way.</p></li><li><p>Pleasure and pain are still somewhat combined as opposites are not yet
well distinguished. The non-separation of opposites and the resultant
ambivalence of the ego towards all objects evoke fear and feelings of
impotence. The world is uroboric and supreme whether this is experienced
as world, one&#x27;s environment or one&#x27;s body.</p></li><li><p>This is the age of the matriarchate as Bachofen describes it. This is
a structural stage of the psyche not a historical one. </p></li><li><p>In men and women consciousness has a masculine character. Consciousness
= light = day  while unconsciousness = darkness and night.</p></li><li><p>Bachofen&#x27;s matriarchate stage is where the ego conscious is undeveloped
and still embedded in nature and the world. Thus the uroboric principle
is associated with of earth and vegetation symbolism. Marriage is an
agrarian matter filled with agricultural symbolism.</p></li><li><p>Plato in Menexenus: <em>In fertility and generation, woman does not set an
example to the earth, but the earth sets an example of woman.</em></p></li><li><p>Food symbolism is key at this stage as the Mother Goddess cultures and
myths connect food symbolism with fertility and, growth and agriculture.</p></li><li><p>The uroboros at this stage is maternal as it characterized by the
child&#x27;s relationship to the mother who provides nourishment but at the
same time occurs during a historical period where man is most dependent
on the earth and nature. </p></li><li><p>The sequence child-man-ego-consciousness is dependent on
mother-earth-nature-unconscious and vice-versa. </p></li><li><p>In this stage the divine mother and the helpless child are emphasized.</p></li></ul></div></div></div></section><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/origins/the-great-mother","query":{},"buildId":"hhQov-9n9ZJl44PoEC1IJ","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false}</script><script nomodule="" src="/_next/static/runtime/polyfills-b36086c0c0ddf7a29878.js"></script><script async="" data-next-page="/_app" src="/_next/static/hhQov-9n9ZJl44PoEC1IJ/pages/_app.js"></script><script async="" data-next-page="/origins/the-great-mother" src="/_next/static/hhQov-9n9ZJl44PoEC1IJ/pages/origins/the-great-mother.js"></script><script src="/_next/static/runtime/webpack-c212667a5f965e81e004.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/framework.c6faae2799416a6da8e8.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/8003419690f01395cad01d494cfca406e5dfa0b8.f5bff6add530846d50c7.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/runtime/main-465c74ec3472c0c07a4f.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/c69982f13e1e86241f9fa3d119473fe79b95ab29.8daf96ba3d5b5e3242ae.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/hhQov-9n9ZJl44PoEC1IJ/_buildManifest.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/hhQov-9n9ZJl44PoEC1IJ/_ssgManifest.js" async=""></script></body></html>
