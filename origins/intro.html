listening if you want more depth on Jung and his model of the psyche.</h3><p>I am relying heavily on two resources that I can recommend if you want to dive
deeper into Jung&#x27;s model. Instead of just providing definitions of the parts of
the psyche in Jung&#x27;s model I will try to give you an idea of the core
concepts and how they relate to one another. It really helps to have
a sense of Jung&#x27;s model of the psyche before tackling this book. </p><p><a href="https://jungian.libsyn.com/">The Jung Podcast</a> and excellent introduction to
Jung&#x27;s model of the psyche by Jon Betts a Canadian Jungian Analyst. </p><p>I have my notes from this podcast <a>available on this blog</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/069101048X">On Jung by Anthony
Stevens</a>.</p><h2>Book Introduction</h2><h3>Introduction to the Introduction</h3><p>What is Neumann trying to accomplish in this book? We don&#x27;t have to read far to
answer this question. In the first sentence of the introduction he states: &quot;The
following attempt outline the archetypal stages of the development of
consciousness is based on modern depth psychology (psychology that studies
the unconscious - Jung, Freud, and Adler for example). It is an
application of the analytical psychology of C.J. Jung ...&quot; </p><p>The key word here is stages.  His theory outlines what he sees as the stages of
the development of consciousness.</p><p>Neumann emphasises that unlike other methods that look at environmental
factors in the development of consciousness, he is interested in the
internal, psychic, and archetypal factors in the development of
consciousness.</p><p>He calls archetypes the structural organs of the psyche, or pictorial
instincts. The unconscious uses these archetypes to reveal itself to the
conscious mind. </p><p>Neumann:  &quot;It is the task of this book to show that a series of archetypes is
a main constituent of mythology, that they (archetypes) stand in stadial
succession in an organic relation to one another, and that their stadial
succession determines the growth of consciousness. In the course of its
ontogenetic (lifetime) development, the individual ego has to pass through the
same archetypal stages which determined the evolution of consciousness in the
life humanity. </p><p>This idea of the individual repeating the stages of growth of the species
is an idea Jung took from Friedrich Nietzsche. Now all of this is quite
abstract, let&#x27;s try to make it clearer.</p><p>What I think he is saying in this statement is that historically human
consciousness went through a series of stages of development. The individual in
his lifetime passes through these same stages as the species. These stages are
composed of archetypes - pictoral forms of instincts. We see these archetypes in
mythology. To the extent he can Neumann is trying to survey all of mythology and
determines its outlines.  In theses outlines he sees the stages of the
growth of consciousness of the individual and of humanity. He is using
this outline to develop thoery of consciousness.</p><h3>Stages of the Development of Consciousness</h3><p>Passing through each stage, the ego transforms its relationship to the
archetypes. &quot;The ability to perceive, to understand, and to interpret
these images is a process of succession in time, ..  it takes place in
stages.&quot; This ability to absorb unconscious contents improves at each
stage and leads to individual transformation and improvement. Jung called
this telos which means self-realization. At each stage the individual can
look at its relationship to these core archetypes with increasing wisdom
and light. It&#x27;s as if we get another bite at the apple at each stage being
wiser and more conscious of the complexes and archetypes that influence us
in our actions.</p><p>Akin to geological layers these stages are not cleanly separated: they
blend together. Pieces of an earlier stage can be found three stags later
and vice versa. The uroboros of the first stage changes in each stages but
manages to stick around for quite awhile and never really leaves
completely - it just manifests differently.</p><p>In each of these stages we see the position of the individual (ego) in
relation to the symbolic feminine and masculine. What do we mean by the
symbolic masculine and feminine?  </p><p>This is difficult to define for us with our modern minds and our current
political thought to get a grasp of.  When we talk about the symbolic
masculine and feminine we want to look at the symbols more in the way the
ancient mind looked at them.  Keep in mind that everyone has masculine and
feminine characteristics in their personality. In Jungian psychology the
goal is always the balance of the opposites in an effort to create
wholeness and move away from one sidedness.  Don&#x27;t take this as commentary
on the nature of gender or men and women in general. Remember in the myth
of the birth of the goddess Athena she is born of Zeus directly without
a mother and is a goddess of wisdom and war both very masculine pursuits.
In other words she is feminine but exhibits strong masculine qualities.</p><p>Let&#x27;s try some word associations to get a feel for this. Clear your mind
and just let these words sir your imagination. I&#x27;ll state a feminine word
first followed by a masculine word and pause before the next pair. Close
your eyes and take a deep breath. </p><table><thead><tr><th>Feminine</th><th>Masculine</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Moon</td><td>Sun</td></tr><tr><td>Earth</td><td>Heaven</td></tr><tr><td>Feeling</td><td>Thought</td></tr><tr><td>Instinct</td><td>Logic</td></tr><tr><td>Womb</td><td>Phallus</td></tr><tr><td>Darkness</td><td>Light</td></tr><tr><td>Listen</td><td>Speak</td></tr><tr><td>Mystery</td><td>Revelation</td></tr><tr><td>Sheath</td><td>Sword</td></tr><tr><td>Unconscious</td><td>Ego</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Hopefully, this gives you a feel for the concepts.  Defining concepts like
the symbolic feminine and masculine is almost counter-productive in the
sense that the harder we try to grasp the concepts the more they can slip
through our fingers. It seems better to circle around the concepts by
providing examples to illustrate.  </p><p>The ego position then shifts, changes and transforms its in relationship
to the symbolic feminine and masculine at each stage. The ego, the
masculine and the feminine are all there at each stage - they just relate
to each other differently at each stage.</p><p>We can get a feel for these stages composed of archetypes by just examining the
section titles of the book. </p><p>Here I just offer a comment about the ego position in relation to the
symbolic masculine and feminine in each chapter. We will do a podcast
episode about each of these perhaps multiple podcasts on some of the
longer chapters.</p><p>A. The Creation Myth </p><p>I. The Uroborous</p><p>  In the beginning - the creation stage - the masculine and feminine
are united in perpeptual embrace while the ego is contained in this
embrace. The ego sees itself as indistinct from the unified
masculine and feminine and lives in parcticpacion mystique.
Neumann calls this stage the uroboros. The uroboros is the snake
eating its tale representing creation, destruction and rebirth. </p><p>II. The Great Mother</p><p>  The ego shifts slightly and the uroboros reappears as the Great
Mother who is both nuturer and destroyer. Tied to the seasons
and agricultural cycle the masculine and/or the ego appear
as the son of the mother who is nutured, raised, sacrificed
and reborn each year (a corn king for example). </p><p>III. The Seperation of of World Parents: The Principle of Opposites</p><p>  Here the ego finally starts to find solid ground by separating
world parents but at the same time feels a great loss and guilt
over the being seperated (think of the fall). The uroboros is
finally starting to break.</p><p>B. The Hero Myth</p><p>I. The Birth of the Hero</p><p>  The hero is born and the struggle with the primordial parents
begins. The son (the ego) places himself between the world
parents and divides them. The who picture shifts and the ego
takes up more space on the stage while the uroboros becomes
the dragon of chaos that must be defeated or the hero is
devoured (the ego dissolving back into the unconscious).</p><p>II. The Slaying of the Mother</p><p>  The hero is faced with dragon fight. The dragon is the uroboros
(or the first parents) rearing its ugly head trying to snatch
the ego back into the unconscious. Killing the terrible mother
liberates the treasure or the fertile feminine.</p><p>III. The Slaying of the Father</p><p>  Even if the ego (hero or son) kills the terrible mother there is
still the masculine side of the uroboros to deail with.</p><p>C. The Transformation Myth
I. The Captive and the Treasure
II. Transformation or Osiris</p><p> The symbol then in the final stage is the mandala where unity is again
achieved but the individual now joins in the embrace of the symbolic
feminine and masculine as a conscious participant.</p><p>Each of these stages is a chapter in the book and will have one or
podcasts dedicated to them.  </p><p>Human consciousness has absorbed more and more unconscious contents over
thousands of years and in this process expands its own frontiers. Neumann
suggests that in the West consciousness has achieved continuity where each
stage is integrated. According to Neumann modern consciousness sits on
this integration.</p><p>Now when he says West this includes ancient Babylon and Egypt. I am really
excited to get into this aspect of the book because its absolutely fascinating.
He ties the myths like those of Marduk (Babylon), Osiris (Egypt), and Christ
together as themes that are the basis for development of society and
consciousness.  This is that ability to look under the current of history and
see the themes that still influence us today that make Neumann so compelling.</p><p>Why is this podcast called The Gods Within? For Neumann that which was projected
outward the gods is still with us in our psyches due to the influence of the
collective unconscious.  The collective unconscious is the deeper layer of
humanity that each of us is connected to.  Consciousness is a late evolutionary
product and the collective unconscious came first. Throughout human history and
pre-history symbols were projected outward as powerful forces or gods. These
same symbols and archetypes determine individual psychic growth as well.</p><p>Neumann states &quot;The integration of these collective symbols leads to the further
development of the psyche and synthesis of the personality thus it has a
therapeutic aim as well. In this process the psyche expands leading to new
solutions and new problems which trigger the whole process again. The collective
human aspect is rediscovered and begins to come alive, new insights, new
possibilities of life add themselves to the narrowly personalistic and
rigid personality of the sick-souled modern man.&quot;  </p><p>The development of consciousness from the unconscious in myth is the focus of the
first half of the book while the second half focuses on the internalization of
these myths into the individual psyche.</p><nav class="PrevNext_prev_next__3uyX5"><h2 class="PrevNext_hdg2__AiWTE">The Origins and History of Consciousness</h2><ul class="PrevNext_list__RKtDj"><li><h3 class="PrevNext_hdg3__2IZIN">Currently Reading</h3>Introduction</li><li><h3 class="PrevNext_hdg3__2IZIN">Next</h3><a class="PrevNext_alink__3W5hJ" href="/origins/uroboros">The Uroboros</a></li></ul></nav></div></div></div></section><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/origins/intro","query":{},"buildId":"Q1_Y2xJdRrMJr5kdN_aLN","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false}</script><script nomodule="" src="/_next/static/chunks/polyfills-0a3f5575d2f25aee06a0.js"></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/webpack-50bee04d1dc61f8adf5b.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/framework.9560630609611a3e02bc.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/95155a76b0aceee2fc17bfe0051ac3667c89a0c0.6f44eeabff952a3d2dc8.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/main-8ac5c84943b047654281.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/pages/_app-060c092a570c4ae682ab.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/e0b1ac830b2d8541e06b7b9a25c777c0e59d5e08.c423120919b895922862.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/pages/origins/intro-1565b12bdaa44d8d68af.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/Q1_Y2xJdRrMJr5kdN_aLN/_buildManifest.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/Q1_Y2xJdRrMJr5kdN_aLN/_ssgManifest.js" async=""></script></body></html>
