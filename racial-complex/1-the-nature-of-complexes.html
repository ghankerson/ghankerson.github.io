The Nature of Complexes</h1><p><em>How unconscious psychological processes like complexes influence the our
ego conscious thinking, and our collective human behavioral
interactions.</em></p><p>Dr. Brewster start the chapter by locating the position of the complex in
Jung&#x27;s model of the psyche. In doing so she gives us a nice, even poetic
review of Jung&#x27;s model. </p><a>See notes on Jungian Analyst primer on Jung&#x27;s model if you want a primer.</a><p>She starts by noting consciousness - the ego - lives inside the
unconscious - just as the earth (ego) is pulled by the gravitation of the
sun (the unconscious). </p><p>The ego, like gravity, keeps us from getting overwhelmed by the
unconscious (sun) by giving us a basic understanding and of our place in
the world. The ego however is not the sum of our psyche just the part
which we are conscious of. The unconscious (sun) is very powerful and can
overwhelm the ego. </p><p>She quotes Jung on the lack of delineation between conscious and
unconscious:</p><blockquote><p>We must however, accustom ourselves to the thought that conscious and
unconscious have no clear demarcation ... It is rather the case that
the psyche is a conscious-unconscious whole.</p></blockquote><p><em>On the Nature of the Psyche, Collected Works vol. 8, para 397</em></p><h3>The Personal Unconscious as a Location of Complexes</h3><p>There is a space in the psyche just beyond consciousness where we have
non-ego, unconsciousness and otherness. Often when we suffer
psychologically we discover this place. This other place may lead us to
seek out therapy for example. This place may be thought of as the personal
unconscious.</p><p>Jung describes the personal unconscious as contents of psyche that:</p><ul><li>Lost intensity and were forgotten</li><li>Had consciousness withdrawn (repression)</li><li>Never had sufficient intensity to reach consciousness but still found
its way into the psyche.</li></ul><h3>Shadow as another location of complexes</h3><p>Jung defined the shadow very succinctly:</p><blockquote><p>The thing a person has no wish to be. </p></blockquote><p><em>Collected Works Vol 16 para 470.</em> The Ego stands to shadow as light to
shade. It is the part of the personality one wishes to hide - even from
themselves. ( <em>A Critical Dictionary of Jungian Analysis</em> pg.
138).</p><p>Jung also indicated the shadow is located in the personal unconscious. The
collective unconscious is also important in Jung&#x27;s model. The collective
unconscious is related to instinctual patterns of energy inherited across
generations (archetypes). Humans all inherit these archetypes. One key thing to
understand about complexes and archetypes is that we do no channel them, they
channel us. They can overwhelm the ego and take control of an individual. The
ego gets shoved to the back seat of the car in this situation and is no longer
driving the car.</p><h2>Complexes</h2><p>From <em>A Critical Dictionary of Jungian Analysis</em>: a <strong>complex</strong> is
a collection of images and ideas, clustered around a core derived from one
or more archetypes, and characterized by an emotional tone. When they come
into play (become &quot;constellated&quot;), complexes contribute to behavior and
are marked by affect whether a person is conscious of them or not. They
are particularly useful in analysis of neurotic symptoms.</p><p>For Jung the Ego is a complex that makes itself aware through observation. It
also shares connections to other complexes.  It&#x27;s power of observation and
ability to manage day to day life give it the impression of supreme power, but
when it had to cope with the unconscious like a dream, it loses its power. </p><nav class="PrevNext_prev_next__3uyX5"><h2 class="PrevNext_parent__2CFBV">The Racial Complex: A Jungian Perspective on Culture and Race</h2><ul class="PrevNext_list__RKtDj"><li><h3>Previous</h3><a href="/racial-complex/introduction">Introduction</a></li><li><h3>Currently Reading</h3>The Nature of Complexes</li></ul></nav></div></div></div></section><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/racial-complex/1-the-nature-of-complexes","query":{},"buildId":"hhQov-9n9ZJl44PoEC1IJ","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false}</script><script nomodule="" src="/_next/static/runtime/polyfills-b36086c0c0ddf7a29878.js"></script><script async="" data-next-page="/_app" src="/_next/static/hhQov-9n9ZJl44PoEC1IJ/pages/_app.js"></script><script async="" data-next-page="/racial-complex/1-the-nature-of-complexes" src="/_next/static/hhQov-9n9ZJl44PoEC1IJ/pages/racial-complex/1-the-nature-of-complexes.js"></script><script src="/_next/static/runtime/webpack-c212667a5f965e81e004.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/framework.c6faae2799416a6da8e8.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/8003419690f01395cad01d494cfca406e5dfa0b8.f5bff6add530846d50c7.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/runtime/main-465c74ec3472c0c07a4f.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/c69982f13e1e86241f9fa3d119473fe79b95ab29.8daf96ba3d5b5e3242ae.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/hhQov-9n9ZJl44PoEC1IJ/_buildManifest.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/hhQov-9n9ZJl44PoEC1IJ/_ssgManifest.js" async=""></script></body></html>
