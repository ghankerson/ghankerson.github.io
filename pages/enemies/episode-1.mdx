## What is an enemy? 

In a sense we all know what an enemy is, especially emotionally, but in
a fundamental way an enemy defines the boundary of our own identity. In order
for me to collect a sense of identity, I have to have something that is
different from myself. The idea of enemy begins with otherness. It begins with
the feeling of here is where I stop and you begin.

At root it is not a malevolent impulse. It is more of a discrimination impulse.

### Formation
The way this apparatus forms in human beings we have a long dependent
childhood where we group up in a relational setting of a family. A family
also has its stories and identifications: "we are this kind of people and
those other people are another kind of people." By the time we reach
maturity, around 25 years, we have already have an elaborate sense of who
I am, what I like, what my values are, and what my ideals are. All this
requires somebody else who sees things differently. 

On one hand this process of sorting out self and other is a natural process,
not inherently malevolent, not something that is designed to be a weapon, but
it is easily associated with the feeling that we need to protect ourselves,
particularly in a moment of emotional threat. As adults we are very sensitive
to emotional threat. We are sensitive to feelings that we are less than, that
we are other, that we are unknown. When we are with someone who feels that way
we can immediately identify them as the enemy: your are the one who causes
pain, your are the one who has failed, you are the one who is aggressive. You
are the perpetrator.

There is an arc from the normal development of all of us in terms of selfing
and othering. The differentiation of self and other eventually gets associated
with are tendency to feel that the bad guy is the other. So when there is
a feeling of threat or anxiety we have a very difficult time stepping back from
blaming the other. 

### Question
When we are in the middle of these emotions where we feel threat or
anxiety, how do we learn to step back? Are there skills we can learn to
learn this awareness?

The first and fundamental step is we have to become aware that we're doing
something in order to not do it any longer. 

We are talking about subjective or inter-subjective involvement with
otherness. Here we are creating an enemy. It's a very different situation
if violence is done against you unprovoked. For example, if you're raped,
attacked without provocation, or even with provocation or in a situation
where violence is done against you, that is a different situation that we
will discuss later.

### Reactivity
When you become an adult, you have a lot of reactivity to things you don't
like, don't believe in or disagree with. These for a sense of otherness.
A sense of this is not me. This is not the kind of person I am. So as you
are walking around as an adult, you perceive yourself doing nothing except
responding to the realities around you. You may feel that other people are
provoking you, especially a partner or say an adult child. So the very
first step is to become aware of how you create a situation by saying
certain things, reacting in certain ways. 

For example, as soon as you attribute a characteristic to your listener,
your companion, your interlocutor, the other person may react by becoming
defensive. If you imply that the other person a quality they perceive as
negative such as they are stupid or forgetful for example, the other
person unconsciously picks up the threat and becomes defensive. This might
be active aggression such as criticizing you, or passive aggression like
stonewalling or procrastinating, or even just kind of freezing up. As soon
as the other person feels a threat by your attribution, even if its not
conscious, then evokes the defensiveness in the other person who responds
and soon a vicious circle has begun to take hold. This can be between two
people, two groups or two nations. In that attribution are these negative
attributions of otherness. The attribution is that you are (the other is)
the bad guy, you have nefarious motives.

If we find ourselves in such a situation and are able to work within
ourselves to recognize what is going on we could probably diffuse the
situation or at least attempt to do so.

Hopefully this is ultimately this is a simpler, more natural way to
understand how these terrible, repetitive, and destructive conflicts take
place because:

1. We have a very strong belief that is a natural part of being an adult
   that the world happens to us. We think we aren't doing something to
   create these situations, and that we are to some extent are the victim
   of these circumstances. 
2. We have to recognize that in this moment I am co-creating the conflict.
   I am saying or doing something that helps to generate conflict.
3. I am perceiving you as really different from me and thus cutting myself
   off from you - lessening the chance of resolution.

The first step is realizing this - that you are doing something to create
this conflict and you are not just the victim. This is the hardest step
and takes people the longest time. This is the first building block.

Humanity has not woken up to this. People do not see the degree to which
they create an enemy because they need that enemy - they need somebody or
something to blame for things that have gone wrong and for the violence
that is naturally in all of us. We want to believe that its someplace else
not in us.

### Equality
For this reason its very difficult for humans to be in equal
relationships. Today partner in marriage and often in business want to
have reciprocal relationships. In order to truly do that, you have to be
able to solve conflicts together. Far too often today, people just quit in
this process and leave. We feel like we are the victim and that it is
happening to us. We don't see that we participated in the conflict.
Changing this is very, very difficult. Doing this is an evolutionary jump.
If we can do this we can find freedom and peace. The evolution of
consciousness.
