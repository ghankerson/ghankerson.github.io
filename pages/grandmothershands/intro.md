# Introduction

In the prefix of the book Menakem set's expectations for
the book. &ldquo;If you have a white body, there will be times where it
will reflexively constrict in order to protect you from some of the truths
you will encounter.&rdquo; I have certainly found myself having defensive
thoughts while reading this book. 

He continues, &ldquo;If you have a black or other dark body, there will be
times where your body will experience a sudden shock of recognition or
understanding.&rdquo;

Public safety professionals may experience both.

He pays respect to the Native American body experience too but indicates that
is outside his experience so he does not write about that experience in this
book except tangentially.

He advises us to notice and experience these reactions and emotions and
then let them go. 

Menakem talks about the somatic or the body extensively in this book. He
notes the traumatized body only lives in the present: there is only now.
The brain recognizes past, present and future.

In the book he promises to trace generational trauma from both the middle ages
in European bodies and African bodies that were forced from there homeland to
show how this trauma had deep influence over us today.  I can't help but to
think this is related to Carl Jung's ideas of <Link

## Our Bodies, Our Country

At the time of the writing of this book, 2017, the country is tearing itself
apart. This conflict is not new. It precedes even the civil war when European
bodies in the Middle Ages were torn apart.  This tension and trauma accompanied
European settlers as they came to America. Growing out of this was the idea of
whiteness that and the racialization of American culture. 

This conflict is older than even the Civil War. Menakem asserts it goes back
the European body trauma from the Middle Ages. If America is to survive and
thrive we need to address root causes of this conflict. He gives stark warnings
about not addressing this conflict - warning that what we have here is akin to
Aryan supremacy in 1930s Germany. 

He offers this book for every American and in it offers new approaches and
tools to work through this conflict. 

He defines white supremacy or white body supremacy as the social, political and
economic assumption that white bodies are the norm and black and other colored
bodies deviate from the norm. There isn't a white culture per se, it's just the
default. Black people have &ldquo;culture&rdquo; by deviating from the standard
of whiteness. In this way, American culture and society is racialized at every
level. Menakem calls the core part of the American operating system. It's
always there; always operating. White bodies just tend not to notice it as they
are the default; the standard. 

He goes on to give an example of a study two economists did where they
submitted job applications to 1300 positions. They used applicant names that
sounded white and others that sounded like black applicants. The white sounding
named applicants received interest from employers for one in every ten
applications where black sounding names only received interest from one in
fifteen.
