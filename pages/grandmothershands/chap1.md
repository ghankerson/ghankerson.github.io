# Chapter One: Your Body and Blood

  For the last three decades we have tried to use our brains to address
  white supremacy in our country but we have made little progress.  The
  problem is white supremacy lives in our bodies not our brains. It's
  visceral not logical. 

  Our bodies have a different kind of knowledge than our brains. This
  somatic knowledge is felt as constriction or expansion, ease or pain,
  energy or numbness and are driven by bodily structures that connect the
  brain to our other vital organs. This nerve comes from the brainstem and
  is called the wandering nerve or the vagus nerve. Menakem suggests soul
  nerve might be a better name. This nerve is not connection to the
  rational part of our brain - it is connected to the part of the brain
  that helps us navigate the world and gives us activating or resisting
  energy. In other words it connects to the lizard brain that regulates
  survival. In a given moment the lizard brain gives commands to fight,
  flee, freeze and in extreme cases annihilate. 

  The body then reacts to real and <strong>perceived</strong> threats.

  White body supremacy operates at this level first - the level of the
  lizard brain.  These reactions are all about what is safe and
  comfortable for the body and what is a threat to the body. The former is
  what the body loves and the later invokes the flee, freeze or fight
  response.  In many cases the brain can overcome this but when there is
  perceived or real danger, the lizard brain shoves the thinking brain out
  of the way and reacts with flee, freeze or fight. The lizard brain is in
  charge of regulating our reactions to stimuli in our environment. It
  gets first crack at a response and only if there is no perceived danger
  does higher cognitive function kick in. 

  A threat can be more than just physical danger, it also can be to
  a threat to our beliefs and values. 

  This is were we live - in the body. We constrict or relax depending on
  what is happening around us. When things around us move too fast and are
  overwhelming, we are traumatized.

  Menakem has a different definition of trauma than the colloquial
  understanding. 

  Trauma is not an emotional response - it happens at a lower lever - the
  body. It is a protection mechanism designed to stop damage to protect
  the body.

  Trauma is not an emotional weakness but a tool to protect our bodies
  from damage and help us survive. Trauma can be triggered by real or
  <strong>perceived</strong> threats. Our reaction to events that are
  perceived as threatening and traumatic is lightning fast - our cognitive
  brains don't even have a chance to figure into the equation. Trauma then
  gets stuck in the body and stays there until we address it - which is
  hard work. 

  We can have a traumatic response to real threats and perceived ones.
  That is why people can get killed in arguments over a simple sporting
  match between rival favorite teams. The body can react as if there is
  a threat even over a football game.

  Trauma responses are individual and dependent on our individual
  experiences and makeup. Trauma always happens <em>to</em> us it is never
  a choice. 

  Another way to describe trauma is that is is a wordless story our body
  tells us about what is a threat and is what is safe. Our thinking brain
  never has a chance to enter into the equation.
