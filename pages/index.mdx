# Introduction

This is my booknotes blog where I share notes on books I am reading and
podcasts I am listening to. This is an intellectual pursuit for me to give
me an area to focus on outside of my career. You'll find a lot of things
that are related to Jungian Psychology.

The reason I take notes is that I learn a lot more when I do. I thought it
might be useful for someone else on the Internet - perhaps you? Eventually
I may offer more of my thoughts on these books and podcasts or even do
a podcast of my own, but for now, it's mostly notes.
