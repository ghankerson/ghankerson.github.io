### Note:  I am trying this for fun.

It's the first time I've tried analyzing a fairy tell. I picked this
fairly tale somewhat randomly. I don't claim this analysis is any good,
but I hope you enjoy it.

## Title: Clever Else
The title seems to indicate that the young girl Else is
quite clever or smart in fact her suitor demands that she must be smart. We
don’t see that she actually is in the tale so perhaps it is intended
ironically.  Clever means intelligent or smart. Definitions of Else include: 

> In a different manner or place <br />
Or at a different time<br />
If not: OTHERWISE<br />
Being different in identity being in addition

The title almost seems to mean being the opposite of clever.  
The word clever implies witty, smart or even a trickster.  Else implies opposite. 

## First Paragraph

“There once was a man with a daughter called Clever
Else. When she had grown up her father said, “It’s time for her to get
married.”

What is missing from the beginning of the tale?  A suitor for the daughter
apparently. He shows up just a few lines later but demands she be smart.
She is grown up. Perhaps her lack of smarts is deterring suitors.
Hopefully she would be balanced by having a husband (embracing her inner
masculine). She marries but he then spurs her for her lack of wits and
laziness.  

## Dramatis Personae in order of appearance:

The Father <br />
The Mother <br />
Else <br />
The suitor or groom <br />
The maid <br />
The servant 

### The father: He plays a minor role.

He states she is grown up and should marry.  Then he send her to the
cellar to fetch some beer.  When she does not return, he sends the maid,
the servant his wife all after her.  When his wife does not return he goes
and checks on them himself. It does seem that perhaps he is wealthy enough
to have others do his bidding for him. 

### The mother

The mother plays an even smaller role, she goes after Else, the maid
and the servant when they do not return from the cellar.

### The servant and the maid

They also go into the cellar to see what is the delay. 

### The suitor

The suitor or groom courts Else but declares he will only marry her if
she is smart. He is then convinced she is smart after she breaks down
crying when she see an axe above the beer keg that she worries might fall
on her future son.  He then declares she is smart and will marry her.
Later in the story he sends her to harvest wheat while he is out working
only to return to find her asleep in the field.  He places bells around
her while she still sleeps so that when she wakes she is confused over her
identity.  When she knocks on the door at home he tells her Clever Else is
already at home and she runs off in confusion never to be seen again.. 

### Else 

Else is the young woman who has come of age. When her father sends her
to fetch beer from the cellar. She breaks down in tears when she sees an
axe above the beer barrel which she worries will fall on her future son.
This immobilizes her (and the five people who descend after her).  Later
in the story her husband sends her to harvest wheat while he is out
working only to return to find her asleep in the field.  He places bells
around her while she still sleeps so that when she wakes she is confused
over her identity.  When she knocks on the door at home he tells her
Clever Else is already at home and she runs off in confusion never to be
seen again.


## Numbering Patterns

We start the tale with an unmarried woman who then
marries (1 + 1 = 2) but then runs off in confusion over her own identity.
Ideally the end result would be 3 (wife, husband and child) but she ends
up alone.  So the unbalance is unchanged at the end of the story.  

## Key Sentences

“Clever Else had to prove she was very smart.”  This sets
the parameters for success in the tale. Initially all thought her to be
smart due to her worry over the axe above the beer barrel. She only
worries though she doesn’t act and move the axe (neither do the other
characters). This is strange as reading the tale the reader thinks “just
move the damn axe.”  She and the others seem to be deer in headlights
kind of paralysis (medusa or inability to look into the reflective mirror
, or inward, and thus be turned to stone?). In another variation of the
tale it’s said she needs to be careful not smart. 

## “Shall I cut the wheat or sleep?”

Cutting the wheat is a form of harvesting food. In a sense its
transformation of plant in to food for the body.   Failing to harvest is
opportunity lost - failure to transform or ascend from the unconscious.
Sleeping is returning to unconsciousness a symbolic return to the round or
uroboros or a form of death. 

> “Is it me or isn’t it me. “  

Here ego has stopped providing stability of identity. Her ego has
stopped functioning and she is stuck in the unconscious. 


## Structures of the Psyche

Else is the ego. She is called to act by descending into the cellar and
retrieve some beer for the meal. 

The suitor/groom, Hans is the animus. 

The father is the father or authority figure complex. He insists Else marry. 

## Tasks

The first task is to fetch beer from the cellar, but six people
enter the cellar yet no beer. 

The second task is to harvest some wheat but it is also left undone.  

Beer is made of wheat so perhaps it can be said there are both aspects of the same task. 

## Successes and Failures

Both fetching the beer and harvesting wheat are not done successfully or
even attempted. 


## Knots and Sudden Changes

The knots in the tale are things that can go two ways. The first knot is
the unsuccessful retrieval of the beer from the cellar.  The second is
Else deciding to sleep instead of cutting the wheat.  

The sudden change is Else losing her identity after her husband places
a string of bells around her head. 

## Motifs and Archetypal Situations

Marriage motif; animus archetype; descent motif; fool archetype.

## Turning Point in the Story 

The turning point is when Else decides to sleep instead of harvesting
wheat.  This leads to her husband turning her out by placing bells over
her head so she is like a fool. 

## Does the End Resolve the Beginning? 

No it does not. Else is unable to ascend from the cellar with the beer
(enter the unconscious and find/learn something of value or transform).
She is unable to harvest the wheat or be productive (symbolically have
children).  

## Symbols in the Tale

Father, mother, maiden, suitor, axe, cellar, wheat, bells, beer, number 6,
descent motif, sleep, and the  marriage motif. 

## Animus or Trickster 

The suitor who becomes the groom is the animus figure in the tale but
perhaps is also the trickster as he transforms Else into a fool by placing
a string of bells around her head causing her to lose her identity and
flee never to be seen again. Cellar and the descent motif Descent into the
underground is a classic symbolic expression of a descent into the
unconscious. Making this descent implies a contact with the contents of
the unconscious and, when we interpret these encounters, a change not only
in the stance of the ego, but also in the overall psyche. Else and the
others are unable to emerge from the cellar with the prize (the beer).
This indicates stagnation and a failed hero’s journey.   

## Marriage Motif

“The reconciliation, interaction and union of the opposites; relationship
between the divinity and the world; the hieros gamos, the sacred marriage
between god and goddess, priest and priestess, king and queen,
representing the mystic union of heaven and earth, sun and moon, the solar
bull and the lunar cow, on which the vital forces of the sky and earth and
the fertility of the cattle and crops depend. It also symbolizes spiritual
union, attaining perfection and completion by the union of the opposites
in both life and death, each partner giving up to the other, but with the
death forming the new life.” (Cooper, 1993, p. )

The tale involves such a union, a hieros gamos. Symbolically, this union
is between the ego and an aspect of the animus (in a female), indicating
a progression in the individuation process, but we find the union to be
ultimately unsuccessful as Else chooses to sleep or descend back into the
unconscious instead of harvesting the wheat or being productive or
transcending.  

## Sleep

Sleep is the return to the unconscious state or even symbolic death. Else
chooses sleep over harvesting and thus is dead or unproductive. She in
fact loses her identity or herself (Self) in the end of the tale. 


## Review of Problems in the Tale

Why can’t anyone fetch the beer or move the axe? Once the characters in
the tale descend into the cellar neither Else nor any other character
fetches the beer or move the axe.  The cellar is the unconscious. All the
characters represent aspects of a single psyche. The failure to emerge
with the beer indicates an inability to ascend with a prize into
consciousness. This is failed individuation or a failed hero’s journey.
Deciding to sleep instead of harvest seems to indicate a psyche stuck in
some aspect of the unconscious perhaps being controlled by the fool
archetype (note the bells).  


## A Psychodynamic Interpretation of the Tale 

This tale can be seen as a tale of failure to transform or reach a level
of individuation.  We have a feminine ego who isn't able to find her hero
energy, her masculine energy. This energy is needed to meet difficult
challenges or even get out of bed in the morning.

The goal of individuation is to take something from the unconscious and
incorporate it into the ego thus reaching a higher level of consciousness.
Else is unable to act and is therefore stuck in the unconscious at some
level. I recall once seeing an acquaintance getting anxious over a sink
filling with water almost to the point of overflow, but failing to act by
simply turning the faucet off. This is what Else’s failure to move the
axe, harvest the wheat and fetch the beer reminded me of.  Being stuck in
the round, the uroboros indicates a lack of ability to incorporate
symbolic masculine energy and be assertive. I am reminded of a scene in
the file “The Matrix” where the real Neo is tethered to a womb-like
machine (aka the matrix or the unconscious) and unable to escape despite
struggling. Else is stuck there too.
