# 1. The Nature of Complexes

*How unconscious psychological processes like complexes influence the our
ego conscious thinking, and our collective human behavioral
interactions.*

(Key definitions are underlined - click or tap the underlined word to view

Dr. Brewster starts the chapter by locating the position of the <Definition label={complex.label} text={complex.text}
source={complex.source} /> in Jung's model of the psyche. In doing so she
gives us a nice, even poetic review of Jung's model.

She starts by noting consciousness - the <Definition label={ego.label}
text={ego.text} source={ego.source} />
- lives inside the unconscious
- just as the earth (ego) is pulled by the gravitation of the sun (the
unconscious). 

The ego, like gravity, keeps us from getting overwhelmed by the
unconscious (sun) by giving us a basic understanding and of our place in
the world. The ego however is not the sum of our psyche just the part
which we are conscious of. The unconscious (sun) is very powerful and can
overwhelm the ego. 
 
She quotes Jung on the lack of delineation between conscious and
unconscious:

> We must however, accustom ourselves to the thought that conscious and
unconscious have no clear demarcation ... It is rather the case that
the psyche is a conscious-unconscious whole.

*On the Nature of the Psyche, Collected Works vol. 8, para 397*

### The Personal Unconscious as a Location of Complexes

There is a space in the psyche just beyond consciousness where we have
non-ego, unconsciousness and otherness. Often when we suffer
psychologically we discover this place. This other place may lead us to
seek out therapy for example. This place may be thought of as the <Definition label={personal_unconscious.label}
text={personal_unconscious.text} source={personal_unconscious.source} />.

Jung describes the personal unconscious as contents of psyche that:
  - Lost intensity and were forgotten
  - Had consciousness withdrawn (repression)
  - Never had sufficient intensity to reach consciousness but still found its way into the psyche.

### Shadow as another location of complexes

Jung defined the <Definition label={shadow.label} text={shadow.text} source={shadow.source} /> very succinctly:

> The thing a person has no wish to be. 

*Collected Works Vol 16 para 470.* The Ego stands to shadow as light to
shade. It is the part of the personality one wishes to hide - even from
themselves. ( *A Critical Dictionary of Jungian Analysis* pg.
138).

Jung also indicated the shadow is located in the personal unconscious. The
collective unconscious is also important in Jung's model. The collective
unconscious is related to instinctual patterns of energy inherited across
generations (archetypes). Humans all inherit these archetypes. One key thing to
understand about complexes and archetypes is that we do no channel them, they
channel us. They can overwhelm the ego and take control of an individual. The
ego gets shoved to the back seat of the car in this situation and is no longer
driving the car.

## Complexes

From *A Critical Dictionary of Jungian Analysis*: a **complex** is
a collection of images and ideas, clustered around a core derived from one
or more archetypes, and characterized by an emotional tone. When they come
into play (become "constellated"), complexes contribute to behavior and
are marked by affect whether a person is conscious of them or not. They
are particularly useful in analysis of neurotic symptoms.

For Jung the Ego is a complex that makes itself aware through observation. It
also shares connections to other complexes.  It's power of observation and
ability to manage day to day life give it the impression of supreme power, but
when it had to cope with the unconscious like a dream, it loses its power. 

### Personal and Collective Unconscious

We discussed the personal unconscious above. Brewster points out that the
collective unconscious is more based more on instinctive patterns and
archetypal energies that we have inherited over human history.

We do not dominate the flow of archetypal energy, like complexes, we become its
channel and only realize the loss of our ego driven selves afterwards when then
constellation of possession by archetypal and complex has passed. 


### The Ego as a Complex

Jung saw the ego as a complex as well that shares connections with other
complexes. The ego's ability to know about current and daily tasks is it's
source of power. It is limited though by its lack of knowledge of the personal
and collective unconscious. In fact one of the ego's main tasks is to defend
itself against these forces.  The ego likes to believe it knows or can know
everything. Complexes can often become constellated when the ego is in an
unfamiliar place. Changes in the inner psychic landscape can trigger a complex
because the ego is suddenly on unfamiliar ground. Often two or more complexes
can be activated as they apply pressure on the ego which is trying to defend
itself against whatever the complexes are trying to reveal. 

Jung thought of the psyche as a system that can auto regulate itself. When the
ego dominates too much of the psyche the Self can provide guidance even when it
appears complexes are being constellated to antagonize the ego. This could take
the form of say a depression. The Self is signaling the ego that its adapted
behaviors no longer work well. Complexes are the Self's mechanism to do this. 

## Characteristics of Complexes

### Disassociation

Through his word associations test, Jung discovered complexes. He found that
certain words would cause the subject to falsify memory and delays in response
due to the constellation of a complex triggered mere word association. He could
measure the delay in response and the emotional depth of the disruption to
conscious, wake state clarity. In other words he observed that consciousness
could be disassociated.

> The disassociated content has been separated from ego consciousness by
definite causes. These contents have never entered into consciousness
although they are capable of entering consciousness. Instead it effects
the ego indirectly of symbolically. The effects usually are not happy ones
however. These contents first appear in consciousness as symptomatic.

<em>(Summarized from Collected Works Volume 8, para. 366)</em>.

Complexes effect our behavior when they are activated - they gather energy
and then discharge that energy during this activation or constellation. We
experience this discharge in via speech, bodily response, thoughts, shifts
in ego awareness, and other ways. 

### Fragmentation of the Psyche

Complexes cause fragmentation of they psyche due to trauma that the psyche
represses from consciousness causing the complex to be split off. We all
experience trauma and have complexes. Even being born being expelled from
the comfort of the womb is trauma - it's unavoidable.

Brewster notes we experience trauma large and small in childhood and enter
our teenage years with feelings of sadness. Divorce, death of a family member
or substance abuse are some strong and common examples that disrupt our
childhood sense of safety.

Recovering and examining this split off content requires reflection,
maturation, perhaps therapy to reveal it to the ego. The revelation can be
extremely emotional.

The ego's inability to tolerate trauma causes us to be forgetful and behave
neurotically. Brewster calls this work of recovering what was split off due to
trauma the work of psychoanalysis. The ways we have disassociated this content
by developing an outward persona to avoid these disassociated contents may
have served us well for many years or decades, but we reach a point where this
persona with its protection of the ego from unconscious contents no longer
functions well and we need new skills to cope.


### Complexes are permanent

We are never rid of complexes. We can become conscious of them. We can learn to
mitigate them but not excise them from our psyche. Complexes cause the ego
duress which is why we repress them - to protect ourselves.  When we become
conscious of them we can have some measure of control over them, but not
completely. Invariably, we will forget them only to have them activate again.
We can can however take a lot of the emotional sting out of complexes by facing
them and wrestling with them. By doing this ego strengthening and transformation
is possible. Jung called this individuation.

Brewster goes on to note that all complexes at their core have parental
complexes at their core.
