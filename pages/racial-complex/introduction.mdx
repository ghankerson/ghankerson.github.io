# Introduction

Much of what Dr. Brewster does in the introduction is outline what she
will happen in each chapter. Since I will be taking notes on each chapter
I won't do that here. 

She does state her goal in the book is to re-envision Jung's theory of
complexes in relationship to the black and white racial complex in
American society.

Don't worry Brewster spends time in chapter 1 reviewing Jung&rsquo;s
definition of a complex and how it fits into his model of the psyche. 

One of the reasons I am excited to read this book is that I think
Jung&rsquo;s model does such a good job of explaing why a racial complex
and racism exist (more on this to come).

On the first page of the book she pulls out the only quote of Jung&rsquo;s
on this American complex form his 1930 essay, "The Complications of
American Psychology": 

>>Just as the colored man lives in your cities and even within your
>>houses, so also he live under your skin, subconsciously. Naturally, it
>>works both ways. Just as every Jew has a Christ complex, every Negro has
>>a white complex and every American a Negro complex.

This quote is both extremely problematic and extremely true. It is
problematic in that it assumes Americans are white and blacks are not
Americans by extentsion. It is true in that isn't that where we still are
in America in 2020? Blacks have shorter life spans, much less wealth and
a often a much harder time voting in America in 2020 just to name a few
inequities.

Dr. Brewster goes on to note that the racial complex has not been
addressed in the literature of Jungian psychology with only a three
exceptions (including this book). She also noted that even in her Jungian
studies Jung's formulation of America's racial complex with all its
problems was only discussed if she forced the discussion herself. That is
one of her motivations for writing this book. She is re-envisioning the
racial complex for the American collective being willing to venture into
the darkness of racism in our society and shine some light on it in order
to make us more consciouss of it and hopefully improve as a society.
