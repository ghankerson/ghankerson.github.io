# 1. The Nature of Complexes

*How unconscious psychological processes like complexes influence the our
ego conscious thinking, and our collective human behavioral
interactions.*

Dr. Brewster start the chapter by locating the position of the complex in
Jung's model of the psyche. In doing so she gives us a nice, even poetic
review of Jung's model.

model if you want a primer.</a></Link>

She starts by noting consciousness - the ego - lives inside the
unconscious - just as the earth (ego) is pulled by the gravitation of the
sun (the unconscious). 

The ego, like gravity, keeps us from getting overwhelmed by the
unconscious (sun) by giving us a basic understanding and of our place in
the world. The ego however is not the sum of our psyche just the part
which we are conscious of. The unconscious (sun) is very powerful and can
overwhelm the ego. 
 
She quotes Jung on the lack of delineation between conscious and
unconscious:

> We must however, accustom ourselves to the thought that conscious and
unconscious have no clear demarcation ... It is rather the case that
the psyche is a conscious-unconscious whole.

*On the Nature of the Psyche, Collected Works vol. 8, para 397*

### The Personal Unconscious as a Location of Complexes

There is a space in the psyche just beyond consciousness where we have
non-ego, unconsciousness and otherness. Often when we suffer
psychologically we discover this place. This other place may lead us to
seek out therapy for example. This place may be thought of as the personal
unconscious.

Jung describes the personal unconscious as contents of psyche that:
  - Lost intensity and were forgotten
  - Had consciousness withdrawn (repression)
  - Never had sufficient intensity to reach consciousness but still found
    its way into the psyche.

### Shadow as another location of complexes

## Complexes live in the personal unconscious.

From *A Critical Dictionary of Jungian Analysis*: a **complex** is
a collection of images and ideas, clustered around a core derived from one
or more archetypes, and characterized by an emotional tone. When they come
into play (become "constellated"), complexes contribute to behavior and
are marked by affect whether a person is conscious of them or not. They
are particularly useful in analysis of neurotic symptoms.
